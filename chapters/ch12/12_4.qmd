## Problem

Consider the economy of Section 12.4, which features two equilibria, one in which the collateral constraint never binds (point $A$ in Figure 12.4), and one in which the collateral constraint binds in period 0 (point $B$ in the same figure). Suppose that the endowment of tradables, $y^T_t$, increases permanently in period 0. Suppose that the increase in $y^T_t$ is sufficiently small to ensure that the constrained equilibrium continues to exist. Show that in the unconstrained equilibrium, traded consumption in period 0, $c^T_0$, increases one-for-one with $y^T_0$, whereas in the constrained equilibrium, $c^T_0$ increases by more than one-for-one with $y^T_0$. Provide intuition. Comment on the responses of the trade balance, the current account, and the real exchange rate in the constrained and unconstrained equilibria.
