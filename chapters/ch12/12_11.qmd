## Problem

In Section 12.10, we showed that the unconstrained equilibrium can be supported by a subsidy on nontradable consumption financed by lump-sum taxes. Show that the unconstrained equilibrium can also be supported by a tax on tradable consumption financed with lump-sum taxes. Show that unlike the scheme based on nontradable taxation, the present scheme must feature a constant tax rate in general.
