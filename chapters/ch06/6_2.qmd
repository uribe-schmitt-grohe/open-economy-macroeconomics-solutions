## Problem

Consider a two-period, small open economy populated by a large number of households with preferences given by

$$
\ln c_1 +\ln c_2,
$$

where $c_1$ and $c_2$ denote consumption in periods $1$ and $2$, respectively, and $\ln$ denotes the natural logarithm. Households start period 1 with a zero net asset position. They have no endowments in either period, but  can produce goods in period 2 by operating the technology

$$
y_2 = A\sqrt{i_1},
$$

where $y_2$ denotes output in period 2,   $A >0$ is a productivity factor, and $i_1$ denotes investment in period 1. In period 1, households can participate in the international financial market, where the interest rate is $r$. They are subject to a no-Ponzi-game constraint of the form $d_2\le0$, where $d_t$, for $t=1,2$, denotes one-period debt assumed in period $t$ and maturing in period $t+1$. 

1. Write down the household's budget constraints in periods 1 and 2. 

2. Derive the household's intertemporal budget constraint. 

3. State the household's maximization problem.

4. Compute the equilibrium values of consumption, investment, the trade balance,  the current account, and external debt in periods 1 and 2. 

5. Suppose now that the interest rate increases to $r'>r$. Characterize the effect of this shock on  investment and the trade balance in period 1. Is it qualitatively in line with the related SVAR evidence examined in this chapter? Explain. 

6. Suppose that in period 1 agents learn that a positive productivity shock  elevates $A$ to $A'>A$. Analyze the effect of this innovation on the equilibrium levels of investment and the trade balance in period 1. How does this effect relate to the SVAR evidence studied in this chapter? 


## Answer

> **Note:** This answer was drafted by Neo and has not yet been double-checked.

#### 1. Budget Constraints

In period 1, households choose consumption $c_1$, investment $i_1$, and foreign borrowing $d_1$. They have no endowment, so the budget constraint is:

$$
c_1 + i_1 + d_1 = 0
$$

In period 2, they produce $y_2 = A\sqrt{i_1}$ and repay debt:

$$
c_2 = y_2 - (1 + r)d_1 = A\sqrt{i_1} - (1 + r)d_1
$$

#### 2. Intertemporal Budget Constraint

Substitute $d_1 = - (c_1 + i_1)$ from period 1 into period 2 constraint:

$$
c_2 = A\sqrt{i_1} + (1 + r)(c_1 + i_1)
$$

Bring both $c_1$ and $c_2$ to the same side:

$$
c_2 - (1 + r)c_1 = A\sqrt{i_1} + (1 + r)i_1
$$

Or write the intertemporal budget constraint as:

$$
c_2 = (1 + r)c_1 + (1 + r)i_1 + A\sqrt{i_1}
$$

#### 3. Household Maximization Problem

Households solve:

$$
\max_{c_1, c_2, i_1} \log c_1 + \log c_2
$$

subject to:

- $c_1 + i_1 + d_1 = 0$
- $c_2 = A\sqrt{i_1} - (1 + r)d_1$

Alternatively, reduce to one constraint:

$$
c_2 = A\sqrt{i_1} + (1 + r)(c_1 + i_1)
$$

#### 4. Equilibrium Values

Substitute the constraint into utility:

$$
\max_{c_1, i_1} \log c_1 + \log \left[ A\sqrt{i_1} + (1 + r)(c_1 + i_1) \right]
$$

Take first-order conditions with respect to $c_1$ and $i_1$:

Let $U = \log c_1 + \log \left[ A\sqrt{i_1} + (1 + r)(c_1 + i_1) \right]$

Denote $X = A\sqrt{i_1} + (1 + r)(c_1 + i_1)$

Then:

- $\frac{\partial U}{\partial c_1} = \frac{1}{c_1} + \frac{1 + r}{X} = 0$
- $\frac{\partial U}{\partial i_1} = \frac{(A/2)\cdot i_1^{-1/2} + (1 + r)}{X} = 0$

Solve the system to get:

- Optimal $i_1^*$ as function of $A$ and $r$
- $c_1^* = -i_1^* - d_1^*$
- $c_2^* = A\sqrt{i_1^*} - (1 + r)d_1^*$

**Trade balance:**

$$
TB_1 = -d_1 = c_1 + i_1
$$

**Current account:**

$$
CA_1 = TB_1 + r d_1 = c_1 + i_1 - r(c_1 + i_1)
$$

**External debt:**

- $d_1 = - (c_1 + i_1)$
- $d_2 = 0$ by no-Ponzi constraint

#### 5. Interest Rate Shock ($r' > r$)

Higher $r$ increases the cost of borrowing and reduces the present value of future returns.

From FOC on $i_1$:

$$
\frac{A}{2\sqrt{i_1}} + (1 + r) = 0
$$

As $r$ increases ⇒ the marginal benefit of investment must increase ⇒ implies $i_1$ falls.

Therefore:

- **Investment $i_1$ ↓**
- **$c_1$ may rise or fall depending on substitution effect**
- **$TB_1 = c_1 + i_1$ likely ↑ ⇒ trade surplus**

This is **qualitatively consistent with SVAR evidence**: an interest rate shock lowers investment and improves trade balance in short run.

#### 6. Positive Productivity Shock ($A' > A$)

Higher $A$ raises the return to investment:

- Increases marginal product of $i_1$
- Households invest more: $i_1$ ↑
- Given intertemporal smoothing, $c_1$ may be stable or decrease

Thus:

- $i_1$ ↑
- $c_1$ roughly constant or ↓
- $TB_1 = c_1 + i_1$ ↑ ⇒ trade deficit

This aligns with SVAR evidence: productivity shocks induce **investment booms** and **trade deficits** in the short run.
