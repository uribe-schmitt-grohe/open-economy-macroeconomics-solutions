## Problem

Consider a two-period small open endowment economy. Household preferences are given by: 

$$
\log c_1 + \log c_2,
$$

where $c_1$ and $c_2$ denote consumption in periods 1 and 2, respectively.  Let $y_1$ and $y_2$ denote the endowments in periods 1 and 2, respectively. Households enter period 1 with zero net foreign assets, $d_0=0$. Assume free international capital mobility. The world interest rate is $r^*$ and households are subject to a  no-Ponzi-game constraint of the form $d_2\le0$, where $d_t$ for $t=1,2$ denotes one-period debt assumed in period $t$ and due in $t+1$.

1. Write down the household's budget constraints in periods 1 and 2.

2. Derive the household's intertemporal budget constraint.

3. Write down the household's utility maximization problem.

4. Characterize the equilibrium allocation of consumption and the trade balance in periods 1 and 2.

5. Now assume that in period 1 the economy is hit by a negative (and purely temporary) endowment shock. Find the change consumption and the trade balance in period 1.   Is the response of  the trade balance in period 1 pro- or countercyclical. Explain your findings.

6. As documented earlier in this chapter, in  emerging economies the country interest rate tends to be countercyclical. To reflect this regularity assume now that when $y_1$ falls, $r^*$ increases. 
Let $\eta\equiv -\frac{d\ln(1+r^*)}{d\ln y_1}$ denote the elasticity of the gross interest rate with respect to the period-1 endowment. Find conditions, in terms of $\eta$, $y_1$, $y_2$, and $r^*$,  that guarantee that consumption moves procyclically and  the trade balance moves countercyclically in period 1 in response to a period-1 endowment shock. Provide an intuitive explanations for your findings. 



## Answer

> **Note:** This answer was drafted by Neo and has not yet been double-checked.

#### 1. Budget Constraints

In period 1, the household's budget constraint is:

$$
c_1 + d_1 = y_1
$$

In period 2, the budget constraint is:

$$
c_2 = y_2 - (1 + r^*)d_1
$$

Note that $d_1$ represents borrowing (if positive) or saving (if negative) in period 1, repaid in period 2 with interest.


#### 2. Intertemporal Budget Constraint

Substitute $d_1 = y_1 - c_1$ into the period 2 constraint:

$$
c_2 = y_2 - (1 + r^*)(y_1 - c_1)
$$

Rewriting:

$$
c_2 = y_2 - (1 + r^*)y_1 + (1 + r^*)c_1
$$

Move all consumption terms to one side:

$$
c_1 + \frac{c_2}{1 + r^*} = y_1 + \frac{y_2}{1 + r^*}
$$

This is the intertemporal budget constraint.


#### 3. Utility Maximization Problem

The household chooses $\{c_1, c_2\}$ to:

$$
\max_{c_1, c_2} \log c_1 + \log c_2
$$

subject to:

$$
c_1 + \frac{c_2}{1 + r^*} = y_1 + \frac{y_2}{1 + r^*}
$$


#### 4. Equilibrium Allocation

Form the Lagrangian:

$$
\mathcal{L} = \log c_1 + \log c_2 + \lambda \left( y_1 + \frac{y_2}{1 + r^*} - c_1 - \frac{c_2}{1 + r^*} \right)
$$

First-order conditions:

- $\frac{1}{c_1} = \lambda$
- $\frac{1}{c_2} = \lambda \cdot \frac{1}{1 + r^*}$

Divide the two conditions:

$$
\frac{1 / c_1}{1 / c_2} = (1 + r^*) \Rightarrow \frac{c_2}{c_1} = 1 + r^*
$$

This is the Euler equation.

Using the intertemporal budget constraint and the Euler equation, solve for $c_1$ and $c_2$:

- $c_2 = (1 + r^*)c_1$
- Plug into budget: $c_1 + \frac{(1 + r^*)c_1}{1 + r^*} = c_1 + c_1 = 2c_1 = y_1 + \frac{y_2}{1 + r^*}$

Thus:

$$
c_1 = \frac{1}{2} \left( y_1 + \frac{y_2}{1 + r^*} \right), \quad c_2 = \frac{1 + r^*}{2} \left( y_1 + \frac{y_2}{1 + r^*} \right)
$$

**Trade balance (period 1):**

$$
TB_1 = y_1 - c_1 = \frac{1}{2} \left( y_1 - \frac{y_2}{1 + r^*} \right)
$$

#### 5. Response to Temporary Negative Shock

A temporary negative shock means $y_1$ decreases, but $y_2$ is unchanged.

Since consumption is smoothed:

- $c_1$ decreases slightly, but not one-for-one with $y_1$
- So $c_1 > y_1$ ⇒ the country borrows: $TB_1 = y_1 - c_1 < 0$

**Trade balance deteriorates** in period 1 ⇒ **countercyclical**

#### 6. Countercyclical Interest Rate Shock

Now, assume $r^*$ increases when $y_1$ falls. Let:

$$
\eta \equiv -\frac{d\ln(1 + r^*)}{d\ln y_1} > 0
$$

From the Euler equation and budget constraint:

- Higher $r^*$ implies higher intertemporal price ⇒ future consumption is more expensive
- This induces substitution toward $c_1$

But if $y_1$ falls and $r^*$ rises, $c_1$ may fall less or even rise

**Condition for procyclical consumption:**

Consumption $c_1$ increases in $y_1$ if:

$$
\frac{\partial c_1}{\partial y_1} > 0
$$

A sufficient condition is:

$$
\eta > \frac{(1 + r^*) y_1}{y_2}
$$

**Intuition:**

- If interest rate increases strongly enough when $y_1$ falls (i.e., large $\eta$), the substitution effect outweighs income effect
- Then consumption moves **procyclically** and trade balance **countercyclically**
