## Problem

Consider a two-period small open endowment economy. Household preferences are given by: 

$$
\log c_1 + \log c_2,
$$

where $c_1$ and $c_2$ denote consumption in periods 1 and 2, respectively.  Let $y_1$ and $y_2$ denote the endowments in periods 1 and 2, respectively. Households enter period 1 with zero net foreign assets, $d_0=0$. Assume free international capital mobility. The world interest rate is $r^*$ and households are subject to a  no-Ponzi-game constraint of the form $d_2\le0$, where $d_t$ for $t=1,2$ denotes one-period debt assumed in period $t$ and due in $t+1$.

1. Write down the household's budget constraints in periods 1 and 2.

2. Derive the household's intertemporal budget constraint.

3. Write down the household's utility maximization problem.

4. Characterize the equilibrium allocation of consumption and the trade balance in periods 1 and 2.

5. Now assume that in period 1 the economy is hit by a negative (and purely temporary) endowment shock. Find the change consumption and the trade balance in period 1.   Is the response of  the trade balance in period 1 pro- or countercyclical. Explain your findings.

6. As documented earlier in this chapter, in  emerging economies the country interest rate tends to be countercyclical. To reflect this regularity assume now that when $y_1$ falls, $r^*$ increases. 
Let $\eta\equiv -\frac{d\ln(1+r^*)}{d\ln y_1}$ denote the elasticity of the gross interest rate with respect to the period-1 endowment. Find conditions, in terms of $\eta$, $y_1$, $y_2$, and $r^*$,  that guarantee that consumption moves procyclically and  the trade balance moves countercyclically in period 1 in response to a period-1 endowment shock. Provide an intuitive explanations for your findings.
