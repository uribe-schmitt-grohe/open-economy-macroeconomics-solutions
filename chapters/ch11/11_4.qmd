## Problem

In the body of this chapter, we established the equivalence of temporariness and lack of credibility in the context of a model with a consumption tax (with tradable and nontradable consumption taxed at the same rate). How does this equivalence result change
in the economy of exercise 11.3, in which $\tau_t$ is a tax on tradable consumption only?
Specifically, establish whether policy 2 induces the same equilibrium paths of consumption and the real exchange rate as policy 1 when households incorrectly believe that the government will abandon this policy in period $T=12$ in favor of policy 2. Consider separately the cases of flexible and downwardly rigid nominal wages.
