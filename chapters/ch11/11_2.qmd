## Problem

Modify the economy of exercise 11.1 by introducing downward nominal wage rigidity as in Chapter 9. Specifically, assume that $W_t\ge W_{t-1}$ for all $t\ge 0$. 

Answer the questions of exercise 11.1 in this new environment. To this end, first compute $W_{-1}$ under the assumption that before period 0 the economy was in a steady state with constant consumption of tradables and nontradables, full employment, no debt, and a nominal exchange rate equal to unity.
