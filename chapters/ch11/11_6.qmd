## Problem

Consider the model of BOP crises of Section 11.5. Suppose $c^T=y^T$, where $y^T$ denotes output, assumed to be constant. Suppose that the initial stock of foreign reserves, $k_0$, is 10 percent of output; the lower bound on reserves, $k_L$, is 0; the fiscal deficit, $g$, is 2 percent of output; and the money demand function is given by $c^T(a-bi)$, with $a=0.2$ and $b=0.25$. Find the date of the BOP crisis, denoted $T$, and the  devaluation rate post BOP crisis, denoted $\epsilon^H$. 

## Answer

The post BOP crisis devaluation rate is given by

$$
\epsilon^H(0.2-0.25\epsilon^H)=0.02
$$

Solving this quadratic polynomial for the smallest root (for we want to be on the upward-sloping side of the Laffer curve) yields 

$$
\epsilon^H=11\%. 
$$

Then $T$ is given by 

$$
\begin{eqnarray*}
T &=& \frac{(k_0-k_L)-yb\epsilon^H}{g}
\\
&=&
 \frac{0.1-0.25\cdot 0.11}{0.02}
\\
&=&3.6 \mbox{ years}.
\end{eqnarray*}
$$
