## Problem

Consider a small open economy with access to a complete array of internationally traded state-contingent claims. There is a single good, which is freely traded internationally. Let $q_{t,t+1}$ denote the period-$t$ price of a contingent claim that pays one good in a particular state of the world in period $t+1$ divided by the probability of occurrence of that state. The small open economy takes the process for $q_{t,t+1}$ as exogenously given.

Households have preferences over consumption $c_t$ and hours $h_t$ given by:

$$
E_0 \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \beta^t \left[
\frac{\left(c_t - \frac{h_t^{\omega}}{\omega}\right)^{1-\sigma} -1}{1-\sigma}
\right]; \quad \sigma, \omega > 1,
$$

where $E_0$ denotes the expectations operator conditional on information available in period 0. Households produce goods according to the following production technology:

$$
A_t k_t^{\alpha} h_t^{1 - \alpha},
$$

where $A_t$ denotes an exogenous productivity factor, $k_t$ denotes the capital stock in period $t$, and $\alpha \in (0,1)$ denotes the elasticity of output with respect to capital.

Capital evolves according to:

$$
k_{t+1} = (1 - \delta)k_t + i_t,
$$

where $i_t$ is investment in physical capital in period $t$, and $\delta \in (0,1)$ is the depreciation rate. In period 0, households are endowed with $k_0$ units of capital and hold contingent claims (acquired in period $-1$) that pay $d_0$ goods in period 0.

1. State the household's period-by-period budget constraint.

2. Specify a borrowing limit that prevents households from engaging in Ponzi schemes.

3. State the household's utility maximization problem. Indicate which variables/processes the household chooses and which it takes as given.

4. Derive the complete set of competitive equilibrium conditions.

5. Assume that in the nonstochastic steady state, $q_{0,t} = \beta^t$ and $A_t = 1$. Show that in response to a positive innovation in $A_t$, i.e., $\widehat{A}_t > 0$, the trade balance responds countercyclically only if investment rises. Then derive the minimum percentage increase in investment needed for the trade balance to fall. Show your answer is independent of $E_t A_{t+1}$.

6. Compare your findings in question 5 to those from Chapter 3's model with no depreciation, no labor choice, and incomplete markets. Focus on the role of persistence in $A_t$. Provide intuition.

7. Find the threshold for $E_t \widehat{A}_{t+1}$ relative to $\widehat{A}_t$ that guarantees a deterioration of the trade balance. Express the condition as $\widehat{A}_t < M E_t \widehat{A}_{t+1}$ and compute $M$ using $\alpha = 1/3$, $\delta = 0.08$, $\beta^{-1} = 1.02$, and $\omega = 1.5$.

8. Discuss how your findings support or contradict Principle I derived in Chapter 3.

9. How would your answers to questions 5 and 7 change if utility were separable in $c_t$ and $h_t$?



## Answer

#### 1.

The household’s period-by-period budget constraint is:

$$
A_t k_t^{\alpha} h_t^{1 - \alpha} + d_t = c_t + k_{t+1} - (1 - \delta)k_t + E_t q_{t,t+1} d_{t+1}
$$

#### 2.

A borrowing limit that prevents Ponzi schemes is:

$$
\lim_{t \to \infty} E_0 \left[ q_{0,t} d_t \right] \ge 0
$$

where

$$
q_{0,t} \equiv q_{0,1} q_{1,2} \cdots q_{t-1,t}
$$

#### 3.

The household chooses $\{c_t, h_t, k_{t+1}, d_{t+1}\}$ to maximize:

$$
E_0 \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \beta^t \left[
\frac{\left(c_t - \frac{h_t^{\omega}}{\omega}\right)^{1 - \sigma} - 1}{1 - \sigma}
\right]
$$

subject to:

$$
A_t k_t^{\alpha} h_t^{1 - \alpha} + d_t = c_t + k_{t+1} - (1 - \delta)k_t + E_t q_{t,t+1} d_{t+1}
$$

$$
\lim_{t \to \infty} E_0 q_{0,t} d_t \ge 0
$$

taking as given the processes $\{A_t\}$, $\{q_{t,t+1}\}$, and initial conditions $k_0$, $d_0$.

#### 4.

A competitive equilibrium is a set of plans $\{c_t, h_t, k_{t+1}\}$ and a constant $\xi > 0$ satisfying:

$$
\beta^t \left(c_t - \frac{h_t^{\omega}}{\omega} \right)^{-\sigma} = \xi q_{0,t}
$$

$$
h_t^{\omega - 1} = (1 - \alpha) A_t k_t^{\alpha} h_t^{-\alpha}
$$

$$
1 = E_t \left[ q_{t,t+1} \left( \alpha A_{t+1} k_{t+1}^{\alpha - 1} h_{t+1}^{1 - \alpha} + 1 - \delta \right) \right]
$$

$$
E_0 \sum_{t = 0}^{\infty} q_{0,t} \left[ A_t k_t^{\alpha} h_t^{1 - \alpha} + (1 - \delta)k_t - c_t - k_{t+1} \right] + d_0 = 0
$$

#### 5.

From the FOC:

$$
\widehat{c}_t = \frac{h^\omega}{c} \widehat{h}_t
$$

Labor condition:

$$
(\omega - 1)\widehat{h}_t = \widehat{A}_t - \alpha \widehat{h}_t \Rightarrow \widehat{h}_t = \frac{1}{\omega - (1 - \alpha)} \widehat{A}_t
$$

Then:

$$
\widehat{c}_t = \frac{h^\omega}{c} \cdot \frac{1}{\omega - (1 - \alpha)} \widehat{A}_t
$$

Output:

$$
\widehat{y}_t = \widehat{A}_t + (1 - \alpha) \widehat{h}_t = \frac{\omega}{\omega - (1 - \alpha)} \widehat{A}_t
$$

Using:

$$
y_t = c_t + i_t + tb_t
$$

Linearized:

$$
\widehat{y}_t = \frac{c}{y} \widehat{c}_t + \frac{\delta k}{y} \widehat{i}_t + \frac{1}{y}(tb_t - tb)
$$

So:

$$
(tb_t - tb) = y \widehat{A}_t - \delta k \widehat{i}_t
$$

The trade balance deteriorates if:

$$
\widehat{i}_t > \frac{y}{\delta k} \widehat{A}_t
$$

#### 6.

- In Chapter 3’s incomplete markets model, productivity shocks create **income effects**, leading to consumption booms and trade deficits.

- In this complete markets model, there’s no income effect — only **substitution** between consumption and leisure.

- Intertemporal prices $q_{t,t+1}$ are fixed and not influenced by $E_t A_{t+1}$, unlike in incomplete markets.

- Trade balance dynamics now depend more heavily on **expectations of future productivity** and capital accumulation.

#### 7.

We have:

$$
\widehat{y}_t - \frac{c}{y} \widehat{c}_t - \frac{i}{y} \widehat{i}_t =
\widehat{A}_t - \left( \frac{\omega}{\omega - 1} \right) \left( \frac{1}{1 - \alpha} \right) \left( \frac{\alpha}{\beta^{-1} - 1 + \delta} \right) E_t \widehat{A}_{t+1}
$$

So trade balance worsens if:

$$
\widehat{A}_t < M E_t \widehat{A}_{t+1}
$$

where:

$$
M = \left( \frac{\omega}{\omega - 1} \right) \left( \frac{1}{1 - \alpha} \right) \left( \frac{\alpha}{\beta^{-1} - 1 + \delta} \right)
$$

Plug in:

- $\omega = 1.5$
- $\alpha = 1/3$
- $\delta = 0.08$
- $\beta^{-1} = 1.02$

Then:

$$
M = \frac{3}{1} \cdot \frac{3}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{3} \cdot 10 = 15
$$

So the condition becomes:

$$
E_t \widehat{A}_{t+1} > \frac{1}{15} \widehat{A}_t
$$

- These results **support** Principle I: the **cyclicality of the trade balance** depends on the **persistence** of shocks and market structure.

- Incomplete markets: income effects dominate → trade deficit even with temporary shock.

- Complete markets: substitution effects dominate → only **expected future productivity** drives investment and trade deficit.

#### 9.

With **separable utility**, marginal utility of consumption is independent of labor:

- No induced rise in consumption from increased labor effort.

- Weakens link between productivity and consumption.

- Therefore, trade balance more likely to improve unless expectations about $A_{t+1}$ drive investment.
