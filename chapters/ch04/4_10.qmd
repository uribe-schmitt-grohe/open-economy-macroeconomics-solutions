## Problem

In section 4.5, we calibrated the EDEIR model using second moments computed with Canadian data for 1946‚Äì1985. The middle panel of table 4.2 updates the empirical second moments for the period 1960‚Äì2011. The present exercise uses these empirical regularities to calibrate and evaluate the SOE-RBC model.

1. Calibrate the EDEIR model as follows. Set $\beta = 1/1.04$, $\sigma = 2$, $\omega = 1.455$, $\alpha = 0.32$, $\delta = 0.10$, and $\overline{d} = 0.7442$. Set the remaining four parameters, $\rho$, $\eta$, $\phi$, and $\psi_1$, to match the observed standard deviations and serial correlations of output and the standard deviations of investment and the trade-balance-to-output ratio in Canada during 1960‚Äì2011. Approximate the equilibrium dynamics up to first order, and use a distance minimization procedure similar to the one used in exercise 4.8. Compare the resulting values for $\rho$, $\tilde{\eta}$, $\phi$, and $\psi_1$ with those reported in table 4.1.

2. Compute theoretical second moments and present your findings as in the third panel of table 4.2.

3. Comment on the ability of the model to explain observed business cycles in Canada during 1960‚Äì2011.

4. Compute the unconditional standard deviation of the productivity shock, $\ln A_t$, under the present calibration. Compare this number to the one corresponding to the 1946‚Äì1985 calibration presented in section 4.5. Now do the same with the standard deviation of output. Discuss and interpret your findings.

Period 1946‚Äì1985: $\sigma_A = 0.0142$, $\sigma_y = 3.0826$.

Period 1960‚Äì2011: $\sigma_A = 0.0133$, $\sigma_y = 3.7245$.

Puzzle: Let ‚Äúold‚Äù denote the 1946‚Äì1985 calibration and ‚Äúnew‚Äù denote the 1960‚Äì2011 calibration. The predicted standard deviation of output under new is higher than under old. However, the predicted standard deviation of the tech. shock is lower under new than under old. How can that be, since the only source of volatility is the tech shock?

Explanation: In the new data sample, observed output is more persistent. The predicted serial correlation depends on $\rho$ but not on $\eta$. Therefore, the new calibration must feature a larger $\rho$, since the serial correlation of output is a target moment. Now increasing $\rho$ all else constant causes the predicted variance of both the tech shock and output to increase. It turns out, that this increase in the volatility of output is so high that with $\eta$ unchanged the model would overpredict the new variance of output. Therefore, $\eta$ must be lower in new than in old, since the standard deviation of output is a target moment. It turns out that the volatility of the tech. shock under the new calibration ends up being lower than under the old calibration, which is somewhat surprising.

We learned that increasing $\rho$ and at the same time lowering $\eta$ so as to keep the variance of $\ln A_t$ constant raises the variance of output. The intuition for why the volatility of output increases with $\rho$ holding the std. dev. of $A_t$ constant is that a more persistent tech. shock causes larger swings in investment and therefore in capital and therefore in output.
