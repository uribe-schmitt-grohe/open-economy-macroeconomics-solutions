## Problem

Modify the period utility function of the EDEIR model as follows:

$$
U(c,h) = \frac{\left[
c^{1-\omega}(1-h)^{\omega}
\right]^{1-\sigma}-1}
{1-\sigma}.
$$

All other features of the model are unchanged.

1. Derive analytically the steady state of the model.

2. Set all parameters of the model as in table~\ref{table:soe-rbc-calibration-SGU-JIE}, except for $\omega$.
   Calibrate $\omega$ to ensure that in the deterministic steady state, hours equal 1/3 (i.e., ensure that in the steady state, households spend one-third of their time working). Calculate the implied value of $\omega$.

3. Produce a table of predicted second moments similar to table~\ref{table:soe-rbc-edeir}. When performing this step, you might find it convenient to use as a starting point the Matlab programs for the EDEIR SOE-RBC model posted online.

4. Compare the predictions of the present model with those of its GHH-preference counterpart.
