## Problem

Modify the period utility function of the EDEIR model as follows:

$$
U(c,h) = \frac{\left[
c^{1-\omega}(1-h)^{\omega}
\right]^{1-\sigma}-1}
{1-\sigma}.
$$

All other features of the model are unchanged.

**Table 4.1: Calibration of the EDEIR Small Open RBC Economy**

| Parameter | $\sigma$ | $\delta$ | $r^*$ | $\alpha$ | $\bar{d}$ | $\omega$ | $\phi$ | $\psi_1$ | $\rho$ | $\tilde{\eta}$ |
|-----------|----------|----------|-------|----------|-----------|----------|--------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Value     | 2        | 0.1      | 0.04  | 0.32     | 0.7442    | 1.455    | 0.028  | 0.000742 | 0.42   | 0.0129         |

1. Derive analytically the steady state of the model.

2. Set all parameters of the model as in Table 4.1, except for $\omega$.
   Calibrate $\omega$ to ensure that in the deterministic steady state, hours equal 1/3 (i.e., ensure that in the steady state, households spend one-third of their time working). Calculate the implied value of $\omega$.

3. Produce a table of predicted second moments similar to Table 4.2. When performing this step, you might find it convenient to use as a starting point the Matlab programs for the EDEIR SOE-RBC model posted online.

4. Compare the predictions of the present model with those of its GHH-preference counterpart.

## Answer

#### 1. Steady State with Cobb-Douglas Preferences

The marginal rate of substitution between leisure and consumption is:

$$
-\frac{U_h}{U_c} = \frac{\omega}{1-\omega}\frac{c}{1-h}
$$

Then the labor-leisure optimality condition (4.11) becomes:

$$
\frac{\omega}{1-\omega}\frac{c_t}{1-h_t} = (1-\alpha)A_t(k_t/h_t)^{\alpha} \tag{*}
$$

**Steady state:** Given $h = 1/3$.

Calibrated are: $\alpha$, $\bar{d}$, $r^*$, $A = 1$, and $\delta$. From page 82:

$$
\beta^{-1} = 1 + r^*
$$

$$
\kappa = \frac{k}{h} = \left(\frac{\alpha}{\beta^{-1} - 1 + \delta}\right)^{\frac{1}{1-\alpha}}
$$

$$
k = \kappa h
$$

By (4.16):

$$
c = \kappa^{\alpha}h - r^*\bar{d} - \delta k
$$

By (*):

$$
\frac{\omega}{1-\omega}\frac{c}{1-h} = (1-\alpha)\kappa^{\alpha}
$$

Solving for $\omega$:

$$
\omega = \frac{Z}{1+Z}; \quad \text{where } Z \equiv \frac{(1-\alpha)\kappa^{\alpha}(1-h)}{c}
$$

#### 2. Calibration of $\omega$

$$
\omega = 0.6567
$$

#### 4. Comparison

With income-elastic labor supply (Cobb-Douglas), hours are, as expected, somewhat less volatile than under income-inelastic labor supply (GHH). The largest difference in second moments, however, appears in consumption. Consumption is much less volatile (0.85 percent under Cobb-Douglas versus 2.71 percent under GHH) and less correlated with output (0.25 versus 0.84). The different cyclicality of consumption also affects the trade balance, which becomes procyclical, with a correlation of 0.45 with output.

The impact response of the trade balance (not shown) remains negative because investment rises sharply on impact under both Cobb-Douglas and GHH preferences. Since investment exhibits near-zero serial correlation in both cases, the post-impact dynamics of the trade balance are driven largely by consumption. Because consumption increases only modestly during the output boom triggered by a positive technology shock, the trade balance turns positive after the impact period and is therefore procyclical overall.
