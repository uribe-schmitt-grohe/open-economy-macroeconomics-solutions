## Problem

Modify the model of Section 10.1.1 by assuming that households have preferences of the type given in equation (9.34) of Chapter 9. Show that a labor subsidy at the firm level   financed by a proportional income tax at the household level(i.e., the fiscal scheme studied in Section 10.1.1) can support the Pareto optimal allocation.
