## Problem

Take a look at the two bottom panels of Figure 9.12 showing the behavior of the
trade-balance-to-output ratio and the debt-to-output ratio  predicted by the model of Section 9.1 during an external crisis under a currency peg and under the optimal exchange-rate policy. Note that these responses differ across the two exchange-rate regimes, even though the responses of the levels of the trade balance and the external debt are identical across exchange-rate policies, due to the assumption $\sigma=1/\xi$. 
Of course, all differences must be due to the fact that output (measured in terms of tradables) behaves differently across exchange-rate regimes. Explain analytically the nature of these differences. Consider in particular the cases $\xi=1$ and $\xi>1$ under the maintained assumption $\sigma=1/\xi$.
