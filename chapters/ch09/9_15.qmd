## Problem

Consider the two-sector open economy with staggered price setting \`a la Calvo-Yun studied in Section 9.16. As an identification assumption, postulate that interest-rate shocks can affect $r_t$ and $y^T_t$ contemporaneously and that output shocks can affect $y^T_t$ but not $r_t$ contemporaneously. 

1. Compute the matrix $\Gamma$ under this identification scheme. 

2. Compute the share of the variances of tradable output, $y^T_t$; hours, $h_t$;  consumption, $c_t$; the real exchange rate, $p_t$; and the trade-balance-to-output ratio, $tb_t/(y^T_t+p_ty^N_t)$ explained by interest-rate shocks under the two alternative exchange-rate policies considered in that Section 9.16, the optimal exchange-rate policy and a currency peg. Comment. 

3. Produce two figures, similar to Figure 9.19, displaying the dynamics of a typical external crisis, conditional on each of the two shocks. Provide intuition. 

4. What fraction of the welfare costs of currency pegs reported in Table 9.9 is attributable to interest-rate shocks? 

5. Answer the questions 1-4 above under the alternative identification assumption that output shocks can affect the interest contemporaneously but not vice versa.
