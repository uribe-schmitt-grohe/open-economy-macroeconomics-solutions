## Problem

Show that any constant interest-rate rule of the form $R_t=\delta$, where $\delta$ is a parameter, supports the full-employment equilibrium, provided $\delta\ge \gamma/\beta$. 

## Answer

In full employment eqm:  $h_t = \bar{h}$ for all $t$ and $w_t = p_t F'(\bar{h})$ for all $t$.

Start with the DNWR constraint: $W_{t+1}  \ge  \gamma W_t$. This can be written as

$$
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{
\mathcal{E}_{t+1}
}
{
\mathcal{E}_t
}
\ge \gamma \frac{w_t}{w_{t+1}} = \gamma \frac{p_t}{p_{t+1}} = \gamma \left(\frac{c^T_t}{c^T_{t+1}}\right)^{1/\xi}
\end{eqnarray*}
$$

where the last equality uses the facts that  $U$ is CRRA and $A$ is CES with $\sigma = 1/\xi$ and that $C^N_t = F(\bar{h})$.

Use the fact that the law of one price holds and that the foreign price of the traded good is unity, $\mathcal{E}_t =P^T_t$, to eliminate $\mathcal{E}_t$ from the above expression and rearrange to obtain: 

$$
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac1\gamma \left(\frac{c^T_{t+1}}{c^T_{t}}\right)^{1/\xi} \ge \frac{P^T_t}{P^T_{t+1}}
\end{eqnarray*}
$$

The Euler equation is: 

$$
(c^T_t)^{-1/\xi} 
= \beta R_t 
E_t (c^T_{t+1})^{-1/\xi}
\frac{P^T_t}
{P^T_{t+1} }
$$

Rearrange terms to get 

$$
\frac1R_t 
= \beta 
E_t (c^T_{t+1})^{-1/\xi} (c^T_t)^{1/\xi} 
\frac{P^T_t}
{P^T_{t+1} }
\le 
\frac{\beta}{\gamma }
$$

Thus, we have shown that $R_t \ge \gamma/\beta$ for all $t$ is consistent with the full employment equilibrium.
