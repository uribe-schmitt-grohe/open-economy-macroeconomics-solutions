## Problem

Show that if the technology for producing the composite consumption given in (9.2) is of the CES form, then the consumption price level, $P_t$, can be expressed as a CES function of the nominal prices of tradable and nontradables, $\mathcal{E}_t$ and $P^N_t$, respectively. 

## Answer

The Aggretator is: 

$$
c = \left[
a (c^T)^{1-\frac{1}{\xi}}
+ (1-a) (c^N)^{1-\frac{1}{\xi}}
\right]^{\frac1{1-\frac1{\xi}}} \tag{*}
$$

Define the CPI index as the solution to 

$$
P c = P^T c^T + P^Nc^N
$$

where $\{c^T, c^N\}$ solves 

$$
\min_{c^T, c^N} P^T c^T + P^N c^N 
$$

subject to (\*)

The solution to this problem is 

$$
P = \left[a^{\xi}{P^T}^{1-\xi}
+ (1-a)^{\xi}{P^N}^{1-\xi}
\right]^{\frac{1}{1-\xi}}
$$
