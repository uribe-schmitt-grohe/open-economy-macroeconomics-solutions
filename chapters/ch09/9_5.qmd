## Problem

Demonstrate that when nominal wages are fully flexible, the competitive equilibrium is Pareto optimal for any exchange-rate policy. 

## Answer

Because nominal rigidity is the only friction in the present model, it should be intuitive that if we were to remove this friction, the resulting competitive equilibrium would coincide with the Pareto optimal allocation for any exchange-rate policy. To see this formally, set $\gamma=0$. Then,  equilibrium condition~(\ref{eq:dnwr_DNWR-competitive}) collapses to $w_t\ge0$.  This condition is superfluous because, by condition (\ref{eq:dnwr_labor-demand-competitive}) and the fact that $p_t$ and $F'(h_t)$ are both  positive, we have that $w_t>0$. It then follows from the slackness condition~(\ref{eq:dnwr_slackness-h-competitive}) that $h_t=\bar{h}$ for all $t$. 
Therefore,  employment in the competitive equilibrium with $\gamma=0$ is the same as in the Pareto optimal allocation. To see that the competitive equilibrium with $\gamma=0$ can also support the Pareto optimal processes for $c^T_t$ and $d_{t+1}$ for $t\ge0$, note that the last six first-order conditions of the Pareto problem listed above also appear in the set of competitive equilibrium conditions (namely, conditions (\ref{eq:dnwr_market-clearing-traded-competitive}), 
(\ref{eq:dnwr_dbar-competitive}),
(\ref{eq:dnwr_lambda-competitive}),
(\ref{eq:dnwr_Euler-competitive}),
(\ref{eq:dnwr_mu-competitive}), 
and
(\ref{eq:dnwr_slackness-mu-competitive})).
