## Problem

This exercise introduces nontradable goods a subject that we will take up in  detail in chapter 8. You may choose to postpone working on this exercise until you have read that chapter.  However, the tools developed in the current chapter should be sufficient to do  this exercise. 
Consider an economy populated by a large number of identical households with preferences described by the utility function

$$
 E_0 \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \beta^t
\frac{[C_t^{\gamma}(1-h_t)^{1-\gamma}]^{1-\sigma}-1}
{1-\sigma},
$$

where $C_t$ denotes consumption and $h_t$ denotes hours worked. 

Let $A_t$ denote domestic absorption. That is, $A_t$ satisfies the identity

$$
A_t = C_t + I_t,
$$

where $I_t$ denotes gross domestic investment. Assume that $A_t$ is a composite of tradable and nontradable goods produced via the following aggregator function:

$$
A_t = \left[
\eta (A_t^T)^{1-1/\mu} + (1-\eta) (A^N_t)^{1-1/\mu}
\right]^{1/(1-1/\mu)},
$$

where $A^T_t$ and $A^N_t$ denote, respectively, domestic absorptions of tradable and nontradable goods. 
Tradable and nontradable goods,
denoted, respectively, 
 $Y^T_t$ and $Y^N_t$, 
are produced  under constant returns to scale using capital and labor as inputs: 

$$
Y^T_t = z_t (K^T_t)^{1-\alpha_T}
(X_t h^T_t)^{\alpha_T}
$$

and

$$
Y^N_t = z_t (K^N_t)^{1-\alpha_N}
(X_t h^N_t)^{\alpha_N},
$$

where $K^i_t$ and $h^i_t$ denote, respectively, capital and labor services employed in sector $i$, for $i=T,N$. 
The variable $z_t$ represents an exogenous, stationary, stochastic productivity shock and $X_t$ represents an exogenous, stochastic, nonstationary productivity shock. 
The capital stocks evolve according to the following laws of motion:

$$
K^T_{t+1} = (1-\delta)K^T_t + I^T_t - 
\frac{\phi}2 \left(
\frac{K^T_{t+1}}{K^T_t}-g
\right)^2K^T_t
$$

and

$$
K^N_{t+1} = (1-\delta)K^N_t + I^N_t - 
\frac{\phi}2 \left(
\frac{K^N_{t+1}}{K^N_t}-g
\right)^2K^N_t,
$$

where $I^i_t$ denotes investment in sector $i=T,N$ and satisfies

$$
I_t = I^T_t + I^N_t.
$$

Market clearing in the nontraded sector requires that domestic absorption  equal  production:

$$
Y^N_t = A^N_t.
$$

Also, market clearing in the labor market requires that

$$
h_t = h^T_t + h^N_t.
$$ 

Assume that the country has access to a single, one-period,  internationally traded bond that pays the debt-elastic gross interest rate $R_t$ when held between periods $t$ and $t+1$. The evolution of the household's net foreign debt position, $D_t$,  is given by

$$
\frac{D_{t+1}}{R_t}
= D_t  + A^T_t -Y^T_t,
$$

with

$$
R_t = R^* + \psi \left[
e^{\tilde{D}_{t+1}/X_t-\overline{d}}-1
\right],
$$

where $\tilde{D}_t$ denotes average external debt per capita 
due in period $t$. 
Because households are homogeneous, 
we have that in equilibrium the following condition must hold:

$$
\tilde{D}_t = D_t.
$$

Finally, assume that the  stationary productivity shock $z_t$ follows an AR(1) process of the form

$$
\ln z_t = \rho_z \ln z_{t-1} + \sigma_z \epsilon^z_t.
$$

And  the nonstationary productivity shock evolves according to

$$
\ln (g_t/g) = \rho_g \ln(g_{t-1}/g) + \sigma_g \epsilon^g_t,
$$

where

$$
g_t \equiv \frac{X_t}{X_{t-1}},
$$

 $\rho_z,\rho_g\in (-1,1)$, $\sigma_z,\sigma_g>0$, and $\epsilon^z_t$ and $\epsilon^g_t$ are independent white noises distributed $N(0,1)$.

Assume that  the time unit is one quarter. Use the following table to calibrate the model:

<img src="figures/5_2_1.png" alt="Table 1" style="display:block; margin:auto; max-width:90%;box-shadow:none; border:none;" />

Guidelines for calibrating the parameter $\eta$ are given below. 


When  addressing the numerical portions of the following questions, 
write your answers to 4 decimal places. 

1. Write down the complete set of equilibrium conditions. Count the number of variables and equations.

2. Let $p^N_t$ and $p_t$ be the (shadow) relative prices of the nontradable good and the composite good in terms of tradable goods, respectively. Write down expressions for $p^N_t$ and $p_t$ in terms of $A^T_t$ and $A^N_t$. Are $p^N_t$ and $p_t$ stationary variables? Why?

3. Write down the complete set of equilibrium conditions in stationary form along a balanced-growth path. 

4. Derive a  restriction on $R^*$ that guarantees that the steady-state value of 
$d_{t+1} \equiv D_{t+1}/X_t$ along the balanced-growth path equals $\overline{d}$. 
Compute the steady state of the model. Set $\eta$ to ensure that the share of nontraded output in total output, defined as $p^N_tY^N_t/(p^N_tY^N_t+Y^T_t)$ equals 0.65  in the steady state. Report the numerical  value of $\eta$ and the steady-state values of all endogenous variables of the model. 

5. Report the numerical values  of the eigenvalues of the matrix $h_x$  defining  the linearized equilibrium law of motion of the state vector. 

6. Define GDP as $Y_t = (Y^T_t+p^N_tY^N_t)/p_t$.  Define the trade balance,  $TB_t$, as $TB_t = Y_t -C_t -I_t$. Compute the unconditional standard deviations of the growth rates of consumption and output, defined, respectively, as $\Delta C_t \equiv \log(C_t/C_{t-1})$ and $\Delta Y_t \equiv \log(Y_t/Y_{t-1})$. Compute the correlation between $\Delta Y_t$ and the trade-balance-to-output ratio, defined as $tby_t \equiv TB_t/Y_t$.

7. Compute other second moments of your choice and discuss whether they are in line with empirical regularities in emerging economies. 

8. Explain how you would reparameterize the model to make it coincide with the one-sector model studied in section 5.2. Answer the previous two questions under your proposed parameterization. 

9. Based on your answers to the previous three questions, evaluate the ability of the 
present traded-nontraded model to explain key stylized facts in emerging countries. Provide intuition making sure to emphasize the differences you can identify between the dynamics implied by the one-good SOE-RBC model and the present two-good SOE-RBC model. 


## Answer

#### 1. Complete Set of Equilibrium Conditions and Variable Counting

**Household Problem**

The representative household maximizes expected lifetime utility:

$$
\max_{\{C_t,h_t,D_{t+1}\}} E_0 \sum_{t=0}^\infty \beta^t \frac{\left[C_t^\gamma (1 - h_t)^{1-\gamma}\right]^{1-\sigma} - 1}{1 - \sigma}
$$

subject to the budget constraint in period $t$:

$$
C_t + I_t + \frac{D_{t+1}}{R_t} = w_t h_t + D_t,
$$

where $w_t$ is the real wage rate (common across sectors), and $I_t$ is total investment.

**Capital evolves according to the sector-specific laws of motion given above.**

The household chooses consumption $C_t$, labor $h_t$, and next period's foreign debt $D_{t+1}$.

**First-Order Conditions (FOCs):**

- **Intertemporal Euler equation:**

  $$
  \frac{1}{C_t} = \beta E_t \left[ \frac{1 + R_{t+1}}{C_{t+1}} \right]
  $$

- **Intratemporal labor-leisure condition:**

  $$
  \frac{\gamma}{1-\gamma} \cdot \frac{1}{1 - h_t} = \frac{w_t}{C_t}.
  $$

**Firm Problem**

Firms in each sector $i = T, N$ rent capital and labor competitively and produce output:

$$
Y^i_t = z_t (K^i_t)^{1-\alpha_i} (X_t h^i_t)^{\alpha_i}.
$$

Firms maximize profits:

$$
\max_{K^i_t, h^i_t} \quad Y^i_t - r_t K^i_t - w_t h^i_t,
$$

where $r_t$ and $w_t$ are the common rental rate of capital and wage rate, respectively.

**First-Order Conditions:**

- Capital:

  $$
  r_t = z_t (1 - \alpha_i) (K^i_t)^{-\alpha_i} (X_t h^i_t)^{\alpha_i}
  $$

- Labor:

  $$
  w_t = z_t \alpha_i (K^i_t)^{1-\alpha_i} X_t^{\alpha_i} (h^i_t)^{\alpha_i - 1}
  $$

**Market Clearing Conditions**

- Nontraded goods market:

  $$
  Y^N_t = A^N_t.
  $$

- Labor market:

  $$
  h_t = h^T_t + h^N_t.
  $$

- Investment decomposition:

  $$
  I_t = I^T_t + I^N_t.
  $$

- Foreign debt evolution:

  $$
  \frac{D_{t+1}}{R_t} = D_t + A^T_t - Y^T_t.
  $$

- Interest rate:

  $$
  R_t = R^* + \psi \left[ e^{D_{t+1}/X_t - \overline{d}} - 1 \right].
  $$

- Aggregator for domestic absorption:

  $$
  A_t = \left[ \eta (A_t^T)^{1 - 1/\mu} + (1 - \eta) (A_t^N)^{1 - 1/\mu} \right]^{1/(1 - 1/\mu)}.
  $$

**Variables and Equations**

The model features the following endogenous variables:

$$
\{C_t, h_t, h^T_t, h^N_t, K^T_t, K^N_t, I_t, I^T_t, I^N_t, A_t, A^T_t, A^N_t, D_t, R_t, Y^T_t, Y^N_t, w_t, r_t\}
$$

The number of independent equations equals the number of endogenous variables, ensuring a well-defined equilibrium system.

#### 2. Expressions for Relative Prices and Their Stationarity

The composite absorption good $A_t$ is a CES aggregator of tradable and nontradable goods:

$$
A_t = \left[ \eta (A^T_t)^{1 - \frac{1}{\mu}} + (1-\eta)(A^N_t)^{1 - \frac{1}{\mu}} \right]^{\frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{\mu}}}.
$$

The relative price of the nontradable good in terms of tradables, $p^N_t$, is derived from the cost-minimization problem to produce one unit of $A_t$:

$$
\min_{A^T_t, A^N_t} A^T_t + p^N_t A^N_t \quad \text{s.t.} \quad A_t = \left[ \eta (A^T_t)^{1 - \frac{1}{\mu}} + (1-\eta)(A^N_t)^{1 - \frac{1}{\mu}} \right]^{\frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{\mu}}}.
$$

The Lagrangian for this problem is

$$
\mathcal{L} = A^T_t + p^N_t A^N_t - \lambda \left( \left[ \eta (A^T_t)^{1 - \frac{1}{\mu}} + (1-\eta)(A^N_t)^{1 - \frac{1}{\mu}} \right]^{\frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{\mu}}} - 1 \right).
$$

The first-order conditions with respect to $A^T_t$ and $A^N_t$ are

$$
1 = \lambda \frac{\partial A_t}{\partial A^T_t}
$$

and

$$
p^N_t = \lambda \frac{\partial A_t}{\partial A^N_t},
$$

where

$$
\frac{\partial A_t}{\partial A^T_t} = \left[ \eta (A^T_t)^{1 - \frac{1}{\mu}} + (1-\eta)(A^N_t)^{1 - \frac{1}{\mu}} \right]^{\frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{\mu}} - 1} \cdot \eta \left(1 - \frac{1}{\mu}\right) (A^T_t)^{-\frac{1}{\mu}}
$$

and

$$
\frac{\partial A_t}{\partial A^N_t} = \left[ \eta (A^T_t)^{1 - \frac{1}{\mu}} + (1-\eta)(A^N_t)^{1 - \frac{1}{\mu}} \right]^{\frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{\mu}} - 1} \cdot (1-\eta) \left(1 - \frac{1}{\mu}\right) (A^N_t)^{-\frac{1}{\mu}}.
$$

Dividing the two first-order conditions yields

$$
p^N_t = \frac{1-\eta}{\eta} \left( \frac{A^T_t}{A^N_t} \right)^{\frac{1}{\mu}}.
$$

The price of the composite good in terms of tradable goods, $p_t$, is the unit cost of producing one unit of $A_t$:

$$
p_t = \left[ \eta (A^T_t)^{1 - \frac{1}{\mu}} + (1-\eta)(A^N_t)^{1 - \frac{1}{\mu}} \right]^{\frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{\mu}} - 1}.
$$

**Stationarity**

Both $p^N_t$ and $p_t$ are stationary variables along a balanced growth path, provided that $A^T_t$ and $A^N_t$ grow proportionally with $X_t$. This ensures that ratios such as $A^T_t / A^N_t$ are stationary.

#### 3. Stationary (Balanced-Growth-Path) Form of the Equilibrium System

Define stationary variables by normalizing real variables by $X_t$:

$$
c_t = \frac{C_t}{X_t}, \quad k^i_t = \frac{K^i_t}{X_t}, \quad i^i_t = \frac{I^i_t}{X_t}, \quad a^i_t = \frac{A^i_t}{X_t}, \quad d_t = \frac{D_t}{X_t}, \quad y^i_t = \frac{Y^i_t}{X_t}.
$$

The stationary equilibrium conditions are:

**Stationary production functions:**

   $$
   y^T_t = z_t (k^T_t)^{1-\alpha_T} (h^T_t)^{\alpha_T}
   $$

   $$
   y^N_t = z_t (k^N_t)^{1-\alpha_N} (h^N_t)^{\alpha_N}
   $$

**Capital accumulation laws of motion (for $i = T, N$):**

   $$
   k^i_{t+1} = \frac{1}{g_t} \left[ (1-\delta) k^i_t + i^i_t - \frac{\phi}{2} \left( \frac{g_t k^i_{t+1}}{k^i_t} - g \right)^2 k^i_t \right]
   $$

**Investment decomposition:**

   $$
   i_t = i^T_t + i^N_t
   $$

**Absorption identity:**

   $$
   a_t = c_t + i_t
   $$

**CES aggregator for absorption:**

   $$
   a_t = \left[ \eta (a^T_t)^{1 - \frac{1}{\mu}} + (1-\eta)(a^N_t)^{1 - \frac{1}{\mu}} \right]^{\frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{\mu}}}
   $$

**Nontraded goods market clearing:**

   $$
   y^N_t = a^N_t
   $$

**Labor market clearing:**

   $$
   h_t = h^T_t + h^N_t
   $$

**Foreign debt evolution:**

   $$
   \frac{d_{t+1}}{R_t} = d_t + a^T_t - y^T_t
   $$

**Interest rate:**

   $$
   R_t = R^* + \psi \left[ e^{d_{t+1} - \overline{d}} - 1 \right]
   $$

**Household Euler equation:**

  $$
  \frac{1}{c_t} = \beta E_t \left[ \frac{1 + R_{t+1}}{c_{t+1}} \right]
  $$

**Labor-leisure intratemporal condition:**

  $$
  \frac{\gamma}{1 - \gamma} \cdot \frac{1}{1 - h_t} = \frac{w_t}{c_t}
  $$

**Firm FOCs for capital (common rental rate $r_t$):**

  $$
  r_t = z_t (1 - \alpha_i) (k^i_t)^{-\alpha_i} (h^i_t)^{\alpha_i}
  $$

**Firm FOCs for labor (common wage $w_t$):**

  $$
  w_t = z_t \alpha_i (k^i_t)^{1 - \alpha_i} (h^i_t)^{\alpha_i - 1}
  $$

These equations characterize the stationary balanced-growth equilibrium of the model.
