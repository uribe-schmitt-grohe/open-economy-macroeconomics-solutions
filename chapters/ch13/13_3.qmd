## Problem

In Section 13.3.3 we studied an environment in which creditors seize $k$ units of goods from delinquent debtors. This threat could be viewed as excessive punishment in some states, because it implies that creditors will take away $k$ units of goods even if the size of the defaulted debt is smaller than $k$. A more compelling assumption is that the punishment takes the form $\min\{k,d(\epsilon)\}$, where $k\in (0,\epsilon^H)$ and $d(\epsilon)$ denotes the debt obligation in state $\epsilon$. Show that the  analysis of Section 13.3.3 goes through under this assumption.
