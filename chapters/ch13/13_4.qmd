## Problem

In the model with direct sanctions of Section 13.3.3, replace the assumption of a constant sanction $k$ with the assumption of a proportional sanction $k(\epsilon)\equiv \alpha(\bar{y}+\epsilon)$. Characterize the optimal debt contract. How does it compare with the case of constant sanctions?
