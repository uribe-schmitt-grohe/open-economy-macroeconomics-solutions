## Problem

Consider a perfect-foresight endowment economy in which an equilibrium sequence of net external debt $\{d_t\}_{t=-1}^{\infty}$ is supported on reputational grounds when saving in international markets is not allowed after default. Suppose that this sequence contains no maximal element but has a positive least upper bound, $\bar{d}$. Show that the reputational equilibrium with debt breaks down if the country is allowed to save in international financial markets after default.
