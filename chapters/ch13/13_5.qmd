## Problem

Consider another variant of the model with direct sanctions of Section 13.3.3. Suppose that direct sanctions are not possible, that is, $k=0$. Instead, assume that defaulting countries experience  a self-inflicted moral punishment. Specifically, assume that the utility of the country that defaults in state $\epsilon$ is given by $u(y+\epsilon)-m,$ where $m>0$ is a parameter defining the severity of the moral punishment.

1. Write the incentive-compatibility constraint. 

2. Characterize the optimal debt contract $d(\epsilon)$ and compare it to the one corresponding to the case of direct sanctions.
