This exercise aims at illustrating the forces determining this variable.\nConsider a two-period world composed of a continuum of countries indexed by \\(i \\in [0, 1]\\). Each country is populated by a large number of identical households with preferences given by\n\\[\n\\ln(c_{i1}) + \\beta \\ln(c_{i2}),\n\\]\nwhere \\(c_{i1}\\) and \\(c_{i2}\\) denote consumption of a perishable good in country \\(i\\) in periods 1 and 2, respectively, and \\(\\beta \\in (0, 1)\\) is the subjective discount factor. Households start period 1 with a nil net debt position. In period 1, they can borrow or lend in the international financial market via a debt instrument, denoted \\(d_{i1}\\), that matures in period 2 and carries the interest rate \\(r\\). The interest rate \\(r\\) is exogenous to each country \\(i\\).\nIn period 1, each household receives an endowment of goods \\(y_{i1} = y_1 + \\varepsilon_i\\), where \\(y_1\\) is the world component of the endowment and \\(\\varepsilon_i\\) is a country-specific component satisfying\n\\[\n\\int_0^1 \\varepsilon_i di = 0.\n\\]\nIn period 2, the endowment has no idiosyncratic component and is given by \\(y_{i2} = y_2\\). Finally, households are subject to a no-Ponzi-game constraint that forbids them to end period 2 with a positive debt position, that is, they are subject to the constraint \\(d_{i2} \\leq 0\\), where \\(d_{i2}\\) denotes the debt assumed in period 2.\n\nWrite down and solve the household’s optimization problem in country \\(i\\), given \\(r\\).\nDerive the equilibrium levels of the trade balance, the current account, and external debt in periods 1 and 2 in country \\(i\\) given \\(r\\).\nWrite down the world resource constraints in periods 1 and 2.\nDerive the equilibrium level of the world interest rate, \\(r\\).\nSuppose now that output in period 1 in country \\(i\\) increases by \\(x &gt; 0\\), that is, \\(\\Delta y_{i1} = x\\).

The interest rate falls to make consumption tomorrow more costly and making it optimal to consume tomorrow less than will be consumed today.\nIn the reverse case, the interest rate is high to make consumption today more costly and make it optimal to consume more tomorrow.\nNote that in this case only “shocks to the aggregate income” matter for the value of the interest rate and whether the consumption is perfectly smoothed across periods.\n\n\n5.\nTwo cases:\n(a) The world interest rate does not depend on the country-level shocks, therefore, the interest rate stays the same.\nRecall from the previous section that country-level debt can be expressed as:\n\\[\nd_1^i = - \\frac{\\beta \\varepsilon_1^i}{1 + \\beta}\n\\]\nThat means that if country-specific component increases, external debt decreases.\nSince:\n\\[\ntb_1^i = ca_1^i = -d_1^i = \\frac{\\beta \\varepsilon_1^i}{1 + \\beta}\n\\]\nTrade balance and current account both increase.\n(b) consider the equation for the world interest rate:\n\\[\nr = \\frac{y_2}{\\beta y_1} - 1\n\\]\nThe world interest rate depends negatively on \\(y_1\\), therefore, it will decrease when \\(y_1\\) increases.\nThe external debt of a country \\(i\\) is given by:\n\\[\nd_1^i = \\frac{1}{(1 + r)(1 + \\beta)} \\left( y_2^i - \\beta(1 + r)y_1^i \\right)\n\\]\nReplace the interest rate in terms of aggregate income to obtain:\n\\[\nd_1^i = - \\frac{\\beta \\varepsilon_1^i}{1 + \\beta}\n\\]\nTherefore, country debt will not change.\n\\[\ntb_1^i = ca_1^i = -d_1^i = \\frac{\\beta \\varepsilon_1^i}{1 + \\beta}\n\\]\nTrade balance and current account will not change as well.\nComparison: When the world component of the output increases, the whole world would like to save to ensure consumption smoothing. However, because there is no additional demand for funds, the interest rate goes down to ensure that the world market for savings clears. Consumption in period 2 becomes more expensive and consumers find it optimal consume all the additional income.\nIn the case of the country-specific shock, only one country wants to save more. All the countries are infinitely small, so there is no impact on the world interest rate."

    "text": "Problem\nIn Chapter 1, we showed that two empirical regularities that characterize emerging economies are the countercyclicality of the trade balance-to-output ratio and the fact that consumption growth appears to be more volatile than output growth. In this chapter, we developed a simple small open endowment economy and provided intuitive arguments suggesting that this economy fails to account for these two stylized facts. However, that model does not allow for closed-form solutions of second moments of output growth, consumption growth, or the trade balance-to-output ratio. The goal of this exercise is to obtain these implied statistics numerically.\nTo this end, consider the following parameterization of the model developed in the present chapter:\n\\[\ny_t - \\bar{y} = \\rho(y_{t-1} - \\bar{y}) + \\epsilon_t,\n\\]\nwith \\(\\rho=0.9\\), \\(\\bar{y}=1\\), and \\(\\epsilon_t\\) is distributed normally with mean 0 and standard deviation 0.03. Note that the parameter \\(\\bar{y}\\), which earlier in this chapter was implicitly assumed to be zero, represents the deterministic steady state of the output process. Assume further that \\(r=\\frac{1}{\\beta}-1=0.1\\), \\(d_{-1}=\\bar{y}/2\\), and \\(y_{-1}=\\bar{y}\\).\n\nSimulate the economy for 100 years.\nDiscard the first 50 years of artificial data to minimize the dependence of the results on initial conditions.\nCompute the growth rates of output and consumption and the trade balance-to-output ratio.\nCompute the sample standard deviations of output growth and consumption growth and the correlation between output growth and the trade balance-to-output ratio.

In fact debt turns into assets and then grows without bounds but at a rate less that \\(r\\).\nAsymptotically the growth rate of assets (\\(-d_t\\)) is\n\\[\n\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{(-d_t) - (-d_{t-1})}{-d_{t-1}} = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\left[ 1 - \\left( \\frac{\\gamma}{1 + \\gamma} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1 + r}{r} \\right) \\right] \\left( \\frac{y - r d_{t-1}}{-d_{t-1}} \\right)\n= r \\left[ 1 - \\left( \\frac{\\gamma}{1 + \\gamma} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1 + r}{r} \\right) \\right]\n\\]\nwhich uses \\(\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} y / d_{t-1} = 0\\) because \\(-d_{t-1}\\) increases without bound.\nThe gross growth rate of \\(-d_t\\) is equal to \\(1 + r \\left[ 1 - \\left( \\frac{\\gamma}{1 + \\gamma} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1 + r}{r} \\right) \\right] = (1 + r) / (1 + \\gamma) &lt; 1 + r\\).\nThe growth rate of consumption is \\(\\beta^{-1} = (1 + r)/(1 + \\gamma)\\), which is the same as the asymptotic growth rate of assets.\n\n\n5.\nStep 1: Change in consumption in period 0\n\\[\n\\Delta c_0 = \\left( \\frac{\\gamma}{1 + \\gamma} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1 + r}{r} \\right) \\Delta y &lt; \\Delta y\n\\]\nbecause \\(\\left( \\frac{\\gamma}{1 + \\gamma} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1 + r}{r} \\right) &lt; 1\\).\nThis follows from \\(\\beta = (1 + \\gamma)/(1 + r) &lt; 1\\).\nIn words \\(c_0\\) increases but by less than \\(y\\).\nStep 2:\n\\[\n\\Delta tb_0 = \\Delta y - \\Delta c_0 = \\left[ 1 - \\left( \\frac{\\gamma}{1 + \\gamma} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1 + r}{r} \\right) \\right] \\Delta y &gt; 0\n\\]\nThis means that a permanent increase in the level of income leads to an increase in the trade balance.\nUnder the preferences used in class, namely, time separable and no impatience, we obtained the result that the trade balance was unchanged.\nWhat is the intuition? With Leontief preferences and agents more patient than the market (\\(\\beta &gt; 1/(1 + \\gamma)\\)) households have an increasing path of consumption over time and to achieve this given that the increase in income is flat (or non-increasing over time), the only way to fund an increasing consumption path is to save more in period 0 and then to use only part of the additional interest income for additional consumption and using the remainder to save.\n\n\n6.\nWhen \\(\\gamma = 0\\), no equilibrium with positive lifetime utility exists."

This internalization is absent under external habits, so household consume more in period 1 under the latter formulation.\nIt is of interest to note that period-1 consumption is lower under external habits than under no habits.

Specifically, the new path of the interest rate is\n\\[\nr'_t =\n\\begin{cases}\nr_t & \\text{for all } t \\geq 0 \\text{ and } t \\neq t^* \\\\\nr'_{t^*} &lt; r_{t^*} & \\text{for } t = t^*\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nFind the impact effect of this anticipated interest rate cut on consumption, that is, find \\(\\ln (c'_0 / c_0)\\), where \\(c'_t\\) denotes the equilibrium path of consumption under the new interest rate path and \\(c_t\\) denotes the equilibrium path of consumption under the old interest rate path. Distinguish two cases. First consider a storage economy with \\(y_t = 0\\) for all \\(t\\) and \\(b_{-1} &gt; 0\\). Discuss whether the anticipated future rate cut stimulates demand at the time it is announced. Provide intuition. Then consider an endowment economy with \\(b_{-1} = 0\\) and \\(y_t = y &gt; 0\\) for all \\(t\\). Analyze whether the response of consumption in period 0 is equal in size to the anticipated rate cut and whether it depends on the anticipation horizon \\(t^*\\). In particular, do anticipated interest rate cuts have a smaller stimulating effect on current consumption the further in the future they will take place, that is, the larger \\(t^*\\) is? Provide intuition for your findings.\nRelate the insights obtained in this exercise to the debate on Forward Guidance as a monetary policy strategy. In particular, interpret the present real economy as a monetary economy with rigid nominal prices and a central bank that deploys the necessary monetary policy to fully control the real interest rate \\(r_t\\). Address in particular the question of whether forward guidance is an effective tool to stimulate aggregate demand."

    "text": "Answer\n\n1.\nThe PVBC is\n\\[\n\\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{c_{t+j}}{\\prod_{s=0}^{j-1}(1 + r_{t+s})} \\right) = b_{t-1} + \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{y_{t+j}}{\\prod_{s=0}^{j-1}(1 + r_{t+s})} \\right), \\tag{1}\n\\]\nwhich says that the PDV of consumption is equal to the sum of the initial asset position and the PDV of the endowment stream. Note that \\(\\prod_{s=0}^{-1} (1 + r_{t+s})\\) represents the empty product because the lower bound \\(s = 0\\) is greater than the upper bound \\(s = -1\\). By convention, an empty product (a product over an empty index set) is defined to be 1.\n\n\n2.\nTo derive the equilibrium paths we first write the Lagrangian for the consumer\n\\[\n\\mathcal{L} = \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\beta^t \\left\\{ \\ln c_t + \\lambda_t \\left[ y_t + b_{t-1} - c_t - \\frac{b_t}{1 + r_t} \\right] \\right\\}.\n\\]\nThis Lagrangian has first order conditions with respect to \\(c_t\\) and \\(b_{t+1}\\) respectively\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{c_t} = \\lambda_t\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{\\lambda_t}{1 + r_t} = \\beta \\lambda_{t+1}.\n\\]\nAn equilibrium is paths \\(\\{c_t, b_t\\}_{t=0}^{\\infty}\\) such that for all \\(t \\geq 0\\) we have the combined first order conditions, sequential budget constraint, and the no-Ponzi game condition\n\\[\nc_{t+1} = \\beta(1 + r_t)c_t \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nc_t + \\frac{b_t}{1 + r_t} = y_t + b_{t-1} \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\lim_{j \\to \\infty} \\frac{b_{t+j}}{\\prod_{s=0}^j (1 + r_{t+s})} = 0 \\tag{4}\n\\]\ngiven \\(\\{r_t\\}_{t=0}^{\\infty}\\), \\(\\{y_t\\}_{t=0}^{\\infty}\\), and \\(b_{-1}\\).\nEquivalently, equilibrium is a \\(c_0\\) such that\n\\[\nc_0 = (1 - \\beta)b_{-1} + (1 - \\beta) \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{y_t}{\\prod_{s=0}^{t-1}(1 + r_s)} \\right). \\tag{5}\n\\]\nTo see this, iterate (2) backwards to obtain\n\\[\nc_t = \\beta^t \\left( \\prod_{s=0}^{t-1} (1 + r_s) \\right) c_0. \\tag{6}\n\\]\nRearranging yields\n\\[\n\\frac{c_t}{\\prod_{s=0}^{t-1}(1 + r_s)} = \\beta^t c_0.\n\\]\nNow sum both sides from \\(t=0\\) to \\(t=T\\)\n\\[\n\\sum_{t=0}^{T} \\frac{c_t}{\\prod_{s=0}^{t-1}(1 + r_s)} = \\sum_{t=0}^{T} \\beta^t c_0\n\\]\nTake limit for \\(T \\rightarrow \\infty\\)\n\\[\n\\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{c_t}{\\prod_{s=0}^{t-1}(1 + r_s)} = \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\beta^t c_0 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta}c_0\n\\]\nNext use this expression in equation (1) evaluated for \\(t = 0\\) to obtain\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 - \\beta}c_0 = b_{-1} + \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{y_t}{\\prod_{s=0}^{t-1}(1 + r_s)} \\right)\n\\]\nFinally, multiply by \\((1− \\beta)\\), which yields the equation (5).\nHow to find the associated path of \\(b_t\\) and \\(c_t\\)? Use (3) evaluated at \\(t = 0\\). This gives \\(b_0\\). Then use (5) evaluated at \\(t = 0\\). This gives \\(c_1\\). With \\(b_0\\) and \\(c_1\\) in hand evaluate (3) for \\(t = 1\\) to obtain \\(b_1\\). Continue in this way to construct the sequences \\(\\{c_t\\}_{t=0}^{\\infty}\\) and \\(\\{b_t\\}_{t=0}^{\\infty}\\).\n\n\n3.\nStorage economy, \\(y = 0\\) and \\(b_{-1} &gt; 0\\)\n\\[\n\\frac{c_t'}{c_t} =\n\\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{for all } t \\leq t^* \\\\\n\\left( \\frac{1 + r_{t^*}'}{1 + r_{t^*}} \\right) &lt; 1 & \\text{for all } t &gt; t^*\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nThis shows that the anticipated future rate cut does not stimulate demand at the time it is announced. Importantly, there is no effect on current consumption regardless of the anticipation horizon \\(t^*\\). But the rate cut will permanently lower future consumption starting from the period it takes place. Intuition: The rate cut has a SE whereby current consumption rises and future consumption falls. But it also has an IE. Here the IE is negative because the positive stock of bonds will pay lower interest in the future. With log utility, the SE exactly cancels the IE effect and the future rate cut fails to stimulate the current economy.\nEndowment Economy: \\(y_t = y &gt; 0\\) for all \\(t\\) and \\(b_{-1} = 0\\).\nLet\n\\[\nq_{0,t} \\equiv \\prod_{s=0}^{t-1} (1 + r_s); \\quad \\text{and } q_{0,t}' = \\prod_{s=0}^{t-1} (1 + r_s')\n\\]\nUse (5) to obtain\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nc_0 &= (1 - \\beta) \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{y_t}{q_{0,t}} \\right) \\\\\n&= (1 - \\beta) \\sum_{t=0}^{t^*} \\left( \\frac{y_t}{q_{0,t}} \\right) + (1 - \\beta) \\sum_{t = t^* + 1}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{y_t}{q_{0,t}} \\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nc_0' &= (1 - \\beta) \\sum_{t = 0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{y_t}{q_{0,t}'} \\right) \\\\\n&= (1 - \\beta) \\sum_{t = 0}^{t^*} \\left( \\frac{y_t}{q_{0,t}} \\right) + (1 - \\beta) \\cdot \\frac{1 + r_{t^*}}{1 + r_{t^*}'} \\sum_{t = t^* + 1}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{y_t}{q_{0,t}} \\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nso that\n\\[\nc_0' - c_0 = (1 - \\beta) \\sum_{t = t^* + 1}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{y_t}{q_{0,t}} \\right) \\left[ \\frac{1 + r_{t^*}}{1 + r_{t^*}'} - 1 \\right] &gt; 0\n\\]\nWhat is different now? Why does consumption go up on impact in response to the future rate cut? There is a positive IE associated with the expected future rate cut. Why? Because of the rate cut in \\(t^*\\), the PDV of endowment stream is higher. Thus, the SE and the IE reinforce each other for \\(t \\leq t^*\\) and pull in opposite directions for \\(t &gt; t^*\\).\nSize of increase in consumption for \\(t \\leq t^*\\) now depends on \\(t^*\\). The further in the future is the rate cut, the smaller is the positive IE and hence the smaller is increase in demand.\n\n\n4.\nBy contrast in the NK model, increase in consumption depends only on size of rate cut, but not on anticipation horizon, i.e., a rate cut in 100 years has same power as a rate cut in 1 year from now and hence there is no Forward Guidance puzzle. In the current environment Forward Guidance is a less effective tool to stimulate the economy than in the NK model."

The first-order condition associated with this problem is\n\\[\n\\beta^t c_t^{-1} = \\lambda (1 + r)^{-t},\n\\]\nfor \\(t \\geq 0\\), where \\(\\lambda\\) is an endogenously determined constant. This expression implies that\n\\[\n\\frac{c_{t+1}}{c_t} = \\beta(1 + r) &lt; 1,\n\\]\nfor \\(t \\geq 0\\), which, in turn, implies that\n\\[\n\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} c_t = 0.\n\\]\nPlugging these two results in the intertemporal resource constraint derived above gives\n\\[\n0 = \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} (1 + r)^{-t} \\left\\{ y - [\\beta(1 + r)]^t c_0 \\right\\}\n= y \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} (1 + r)^{-t} - c_0 \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\beta^t\n= \\frac{1 + r}{r} y - \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta} c_0,\n\\]\nwhich implies the following solution for the initial level of consumption:\n\\[\nc_0 = (1 - \\beta) \\frac{1 + r}{r} y &gt; y.\n\\]\nRecall that \\(y\\) is the constant equilibrium path of consumption under the more standard assumption \\(\\beta(1 + r) = 1\\). Thus, summing up, we have that when \\(\\beta(1 + r) &lt; 1\\), consumption is initially higher than its equilibrium value under the assumption \\(\\beta(1 + r) = 1\\), and then gradually falls to zero at the gross rate \\(\\beta(1 + r) &lt; 1\\).\nIntuitively, households in this economy are impatient relative to the market discount factor \\(1/(1 + r)\\), and, as a result, consume a lot at the beginning and nothing at the ‘end’ of their never-ending lives. A story similar to that in the 1995 movie Leaving Las Vegas, but in infinite horizon.\n\n\n2.\nIn period 0, we have that\n\\[\nd_0 = c_0 - y = \\frac{y}{r} - \\beta \\frac{1 + r}{r} y.\n\\]\nWe calculated before that \\(c_0 &gt; y\\), so we have that \\(d_0 &gt; 0 = d_{-1}\\). Thus, debt increases in period 0.\nNow consider the long run. Taking the limit of the left- and right-hand sides of the sequential resource constraint for \\(t \\to \\infty\\), we get\n\\[\n\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} d_t = (1 + r) \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} d_t + \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} c_t - y.\n\\]\nRecalling that \\(\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} c_t = 0\\), we obtain\n\\[\n\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} d_t = \\frac{y}{r} &gt; d_0.\n\\]\nThe long-run value of debt is higher than its value in period 0. It can be shown that the convergence is monotonic and dictated by the equation\n\\[\nd_t = \\frac{y}{r} \\left\\{ 1 - [\\beta(1 + r)]^{t+1} \\right\\}.\n\\]\nThe proof is by induction. We already showed that it holds for \\(t = 0\\), that is,\n\\[\nd_0 = \\left\\{ 1 - [\\beta(1 + r)]^{1+0} \\right\\} \\frac{y}{r}.\n\\]\nSuppose it holds for an arbitrary \\(t \\geq 0\\), then we need to show it also holds for \\(t + 1\\). By the budget constraint:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nd_{t+1} &= (1 + r) d_t + c_{t+1} - y \\\\\n&= (1 + r) d_t + \\beta^{t+1} (1 + r)^{t+1} (1 - \\beta) \\frac{1 + r}{r} y - y \\\\\n&= (1 + r) \\left[ 1 - \\beta^{t+1}(1 + r)^{t+1} \\right] \\frac{y}{r} + \\beta^{t+1} (1 + r)^{t+2} (1 - \\beta) \\frac{y}{r} - y \\\\\n&= \\left[ 1 - \\beta^{t+1}(1 + r)^{t+2} \\right] \\frac{y}{r} + \\beta^{t+1} (1 + r)^{t+2} (1 - \\beta) \\frac{y}{r} \\\\\n&= \\left[ 1 - \\beta^{t+2} (1 + r)^{t+2} \\right] \\frac{y}{r}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nSuppose one had been unsure that debt converges to a constant, the above solution for \\(d_t\\) also shows it.\n\n\n3.\nThe trade balance is defined as \\(tb_t = y - c_t\\). The initial trade balance is negative, since, as shown above, \\(c_0 &gt; y\\). Since consumption is monotonically decreasing, we have that the trade balance improves monotonically. At some point it turns into a surplus. In the long run, the trade balance equals the endowment \\(y\\)."

It says that after deteriorating in period 0, the trade balance improves to a level higher than in the original steady state.\nThe stock of debt increases in period 0. To see this, write\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nd_0 &= (1 + r) d_{-1} - tb_0 \\\\\n&= (1 + r) d_{-1} - tb_{-1} - (tb_0 - tb_{-1}) \\\\\n&= d_{-1} - (tb_0 - tb_{-1}) \\\\\n&&gt; d_{-1}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nsince \\(tb_0 - tb_{-1} &lt; 0\\). Because the trade balance is constant (and equal to \\(tb''\\)) from period 1 on, we have that the evolution of debt satisfies\n\\[\nd_t = (1 + r) d_{t-1} - tb''; \\quad t \\geq 1\n\\]\nThe only nonexplosive solution to this expression is\n\\[\nd_t = d_0; \\quad t \\geq 1\n\\]\nwhich means that\n\\[\ntb'' = r d_0 &gt; r \\bar{d}\n\\]\nThis explains the last line of (*). Summarizing,\n\\[\nd_t =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\bar{d} & t &lt; 0 \\\\\nd' &gt; \\bar{d} & t = 0 \\\\\nd'' &gt; \\bar{d} & t &gt; 0\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nThe current account, being the change in the stock of debt, is negative in period 0 and 0 thereafter,\n\\[\nca_t =\n\\begin{cases}\n0 & t &lt; 0 \\\\\n-(d' - \\bar{d}) &lt; 0 & t = 0 \\\\\n0 & t &gt; 0\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n\n2.\nThe key difference is that under a permanent but anticipated increase in productivity, output does not increase in period 0. This is because at \\(t = 0\\) \\(A_t\\) and \\(k_t\\) are still at their old values \\(\\bar{A}\\) and \\(\\bar{k}\\). In the unanticipated case, by contrast, \\(A_0 = A' &gt; \\bar{A}\\) and \\(k_0 = \\bar{k}\\), so output increases in period 0. Besides this, the two cases are similar in the sense that in period 0 consumption and investment increase, and the trade balance deteriorates.\n\n\n3.\n\n(a)\nFrom the equilibrium condition \\(k_{t+1} = \\kappa(A_{t+1}/r)\\), we have that \\(k_t = \\bar{k} \\equiv \\kappa(\\bar{A}/r)\\) for \\(t \\leq 0\\), \\(k_1 = k' \\equiv \\kappa(A'/r)\\), and \\(k_t = \\bar{k}\\) for \\(t &gt; 1\\). So we have that\n\\[\nk_t =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\bar{k} & t &lt; 0 \\\\\n\\bar{k} & t = 0 \\\\\nk' &gt; \\bar{k} & t = 1 \\\\\n\\bar{k} & t &gt; 1\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\\[\ni_t =\n\\begin{cases}\n0 & t &lt; 0 \\\\\nk' - \\bar{k} &gt; 0 & t = 0 \\\\\n\\bar{k} - k' &lt; 0 & t = 1 \\\\\n0 & t &gt; 1\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\\[\ny_t =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\bar{A}F(\\bar{k}) & t &lt; 0 \\\\\n\\bar{A}F(\\bar{k}) & t = 0 \\\\\nA'F(k') &gt; y_0 & t = 1 \\\\\n\\bar{A}F(\\bar{k}) & t &gt; 1\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nFrom the intertemporal resource constraint and the fact that \\(c_t = c_0\\) for all \\(t\\) we have:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nrd_{-1} + c_0 &= \\frac{r}{1 + r} \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{A_t F(k_t) - (k_{t+1} - k_t)}{(1 + r)^t}\\\\\n&= \\frac{r}{1 + r} \\left[ \\left( \\frac{1 + r}{r} \\right) \\bar{A}F(\\bar{k}) + \\frac{1}{1 + r}(A'F(k') - \\bar{A}F(\\bar{k})) - (k' - \\bar{k}) + \\frac{1}{1 + r}(k' - \\bar{k}) \\right]\\\\\n&= \\bar{A}F(\\bar{k}) + \\frac{r}{(1 + r)^2} \\left[ A'F(k') - \\bar{A}F(\\bar{k}) - r(k' - \\bar{k}) \\right]\\\\\n&= \\bar{A}F(\\bar{k}) + \\frac{r}{(1 + r)^2} \\left[ A'F(k') - \\bar{A}F(\\bar{k}) - A'F'(k')(k' - \\bar{k}) \\right]\\\\\n&= rd_{-1} + c_{-1} + \\frac{r}{(1 + r)^2} \\left[ A'F(\\bar{k}) - \\bar{A}F(\\bar{k}) + A'F(k') - A'F(\\bar{k})- A'F'(k')(k' - \\bar{k}) \\right]\\\\\n&&gt; rd_{-1} + c_{-1}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhich implies that\n\\[\nc_0 &gt; c_{-1}\n\\]\nthat is, consumption jumps up in period 0 and stays at that higher level thereafter. Comparing this derivation with the one for an anticipated permanent productivity shock, it is clear that the increase in consumption is now smaller. The trade balance deteriorates in period 0. To see this, write\n\\[\ntb_0 - tb_{-1} = (y_0 - y_{-1}) - (c_0 - c_{-1}) - (i_0 - i_{-1})\n\\]\nand note that \\(y_0 - y_{-1} = 0\\), \\(c_0 - c_{-1} &gt; 0\\), and \\(i_0 &gt; 0\\). The deterioration in the trade balance is smaller than in the case in which the anticipated productivity shock is permanent, because now the increase in consumption is smaller. In period 1 the trade balance improves:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ntb_1 - tb_0 &= (y_1 - y_0) - (c_1 - c_0) - (i_1 - i_0) \\\\\n&= A'F(k') - \\bar{A}F(\\bar{k}) + 2(k' - \\bar{k}) \\\\\n&&gt; 0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIn period 2 the trade balance deteriorates because output falls from \\(A'F(k')\\) to \\(\\bar{A}F(\\bar{k})\\), and investment goes from negative to zero:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ntb_2 - tb_1 &= (y_2 - y_1) - (c_2 - c_1) - (i_2 - i_1) \\\\\n&= \\bar{A}F(\\bar{k}) - A'F(k') - (k' - \\bar{k}) \\\\\n&&lt; 0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nAs we will see shortly, the trade balance in period 2 is lower than in the original steady state. From period 2 on, output is constant and equal to \\(\\bar{A}F(\\bar{k})\\), consumption is constant and equal to \\(c_0\\), and investment is zero, so the trade balance is constant and equal to \\(\\bar{A}F(\\bar{k}) - c_0 &lt; \\bar{A}F(\\bar{k}) - c_{-1} = tb_{-1} = r\\bar{d}\\). Summarizing,\n\\[\ntb_t =\n\\begin{cases}\nrd_{-1} & t &lt; 0 \\\\\ntb' &lt; rd_{-1} & t = 0 \\\\\ntb'' &gt; tb' & t = 1 \\\\\nrd_{-1} &lt; tb'' & t &gt; 1\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nThe stock of debt increases in period 0. To see this, write\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nd_0 &= (1 + r)d_{-1} - tb_0 \\\\\n&= (1 + r)d_{-1} - tb_{-1} - (tb_0 - tb_{-1}) \\\\\n&= d_{-1} - (tb_0 - tb_{-1}) \\\\\n&&gt; d_{-1}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nsince \\(tb_0 &lt; tb_{-1}\\). In period 1, debt falls to a level lower than in the original steady state. To see this, recall that the trade balance is constant from period 2 on, so the evolution of debt satisfies\n\\[\nd_t = (1 + r)d_{t-1} - tb_2, \\quad t \\geq 2\n\\]\nwhich means that the only nonexplosive solution is\n\\[\nd_t = d_1 = tb_2 / r = (\\bar{A}F(\\bar{k}) - c_0)/r &lt; (\\bar{A}F(\\bar{k}) - c_{-1})/r = tb_{-1}/r = d_{-1} = \\bar{d},\n\\]\nfor \\(t \\geq 1\\). So we can write\n\\[\nd_t =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\bar{d} & t &lt; 0 \\\\\nd' &gt; \\bar{d} & t = 0 \\\\\nd'' &lt; \\bar{d} & t &gt; 0\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nThe current account, being the change in the stock of debt, is negative in period 0, positive in period 1, and 0 thereafter,\n\\[\nca_t =\n\\begin{cases}\n0 & t &lt; 0 \\\\\n-(d' - \\bar{d}) &lt; 0 & t = 0 \\\\\n-(d'' - d') &gt; 0 & t = 1 \\\\\n0 & t &gt; 1\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n\n(b)\nThe key diﬀerence is in the trade balance and the current account. Both deteriorate when the temporary shock is anticipated but improve when it is unanticipated. This is primarily because in the former case in period 0 investment increases and output is unchanged, whereas in the latter case investment is unchanged and output increases.\n\n\n(c)\nAn anticipated endowment shock would also cause a deterioration in the trade balance and the current account in period 0, because output is unchanged but consumption increases (as households feel richer). However, the deterioration in the external accounts is smaller, because in the economy with capital investment is a second source of increase in domestic absorption."

First find the intertemporal budget constraint as\n\\[\n\\sum_{t = 0}^{\\infty} \\frac{A_t^{1 - \\alpha} K_t^{\\alpha} + K_t - K_{t + 1} - C_t}{(1 + r)^t} = (1 + r) D_{-1}\n\\]\nExpress in terms of \\(k_t\\) and \\(c_t\\):\n\\[\n\\sum_{t = 0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\gamma^t}{(1 + r)^t} \\left[ k_t^{\\alpha} + k_t - \\gamma k_{t + 1} - c_0 \\right] = (1 + r) D_{-1} / A_0\n\\]\nWe know the time path of \\(k_t\\). Therefore the above intertemporal budget constraint represents one equation in one unknown, \\(c_0\\). Solve for \\(c_0\\):\n\\[\nk_0^{\\alpha} + k_0 - \\gamma k_1 + \\frac{\\gamma}{1 + r - \\gamma} \\left[ k_1^{\\alpha} + k_1 - \\gamma k_1 \\right] = (1 + r) D_{-1} / A_0 + \\frac{1 + r}{1 + r - \\gamma} c_0\n\\]\nWith \\(k_0\\) and \\(k_1\\) known, we can solve for \\(c_0\\). We then also have found \\(C_t = \\gamma^t A_0 c_0\\) for all \\(t \\geq 0\\). \\(K_{t+1} = k_1 A_{t+1} = k_1 \\gamma^{t+1} A_0\\) ; \\(Y_t = k_t^{\\alpha} \\gamma^t A_0\\).

    "text": "Problem\nConsider a world with two economies, Canada and the United States, indexed by \\(i=Can,US\\), respectively. Suppose that both economies are populated by a large number of identical households with preferences given by\n\\[\nE_0 \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty}\n\\beta^t \\frac{\\left[\nc^i_t - \\frac{\n(h^i_t)^{\\omega}}{\\omega}\\right]^{1-\\sigma} - 1}{1 - \\sigma},\n\\]\nwhere \\(c^i_t\\) and \\(h^i_t\\) denote, respectively, consumption and hours worked in country \\(i\\) in period \\(t\\). In both countries, households operate a technology that produces output, denoted \\(y^i_t\\), using labor and capital, denoted \\(k^i_t\\). The production technology is Cobb-Douglas and is given by\n\\[\ny^i_t = A^i_t (k^i_t)^{\\alpha} (h^i_t)^{1-\\alpha},\n\\]\nwhere \\(A^i_t\\) denotes a productivity shock in country \\(i\\), which evolves according to the following AR(1) process:\n\\[\n\\ln A^i_{t+1} = \\rho^i \\ln A^i_t + \\eta^i \\epsilon^i_{t+1},\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\epsilon^i_t\\) is an i.i.d. innovation with mean zero and variance one, and \\(\\rho^i\\) and \\(\\eta^i\\) are country-specific parameters. Both countries produce the same good. The evolution of capital obeys the following law of motion:\n\\[\nk^i_{t+1} = k^i_t + \\frac{1}{\\phi^i} \\left[ \\left( \\frac{i^i_t}{\\delta k^i_t} \\right)^{\\phi^i} - 1 \\right] \\delta k^i_t,\n\\]\nwhere \\(i^i_t\\) denotes investment in country \\(i\\), and \\(\\phi^i\\) is a country-specific parameter.\nAssume that asset markets are complete and that there exists free mobility of goods and financial assets between the United States and Canada, but that labor and installed capital are immobile across countries. Finally, assume that Canada has measure zero relative to the United States, so that the latter can be modeled as a closed economy.\nConsider the business cycle regularities for Canada for the period 1960–2011 shown in Exercise 4.10. The following table displays observed standard deviations, serial correlations, and correlations with output for the United States for 1960–2011. The data are annual and are expressed in per capita terms. The series \\(y\\), \\(c\\), and \\(i\\) are in logs, and the series \\(tb/y\\) is in levels. All series were quadratically detrended. Standard deviations are measured in percentage points.\n\nSource: Own calculations based on data from World Development Indicators.\n\nCalibrate the model as follows. Assume that the deterministic steady-state levels of consumption per capita are the same in Canada and the United States. Set \\(\\beta = 1/1.04\\), \\(\\sigma = 2\\), \\(\\omega = 1.455\\), \\(\\alpha = 0.32\\), and \\(\\delta = 0.10\\). Set the remaining six parameters, \\(\\rho^i\\), \\(\\eta^i\\), and \\(\\phi^i\\), for \\(i = \\text{Can, US}\\), to match the observed standard deviations and serial correlations of output and the standard deviations of investment in Canada and the United States. Use a distance minimization procedure as in exercise 4.8.\nApproximate the equilibrium dynamics up to first order. Produce the theoretical counterparts of the two tables showing Canadian and U.S. business-cycle regularities.\nComment on the ability of the model to explain observed business cycles in Canada and the United States.\nPlot the response of Canadian output, consumption, investment, hours, and the trade-balance-to-output ratio to a unit innovation in the Canadian productivity shock. On the same plot, show the response of the Canadian variables to a unit innovation to the U.S. productivity shock. Discuss the differences in the responses to a domestic and a foreign technology shock and provide intuition.\nCompare, by means of a graph and a discussion, the predicted responses of Canada and the United States to a unit innovation in the U.S. productivity shock. The graph should include the same variables as the one for the previous question.\nCompute the fraction of the volatilities of Canadian output and the trade-balance-to-output ratio explained by the U.S. productivity shock according to the present model. To this end, set \\(\\eta^{\\text{Can}} = 0\\), and compute the two standard deviations of interest. Then take the ratio of these standard deviations to their respective counterparts when both shocks are active.\nThis question aims to quantify the importance of common shocks as drivers of the U.S.–Canadian business cycle. Replace the process for the Canadian productivity shock with the following one:\n\n\\[\n\\ln A^{\\text{Can}}_{t+1} = \\rho^{\\text{Can}} \\ln A^{\\text{Can}}_t + \\eta^{\\text{Can}} \\epsilon^{\\text{Can}}_{t+1} + \\nu \\epsilon^{\\text{US}}_{t+1}.\n\\]\nAll other aspects of the model are as before. Recalibrate the model using an augmented version of the strategy described above that includes an additional parameter, \\(\\nu\\), and an additional target, the cross-country correlation of output, which in the sample used here is 0.64. Report the new set of calibrated parameters. Compute the variance of Canadian output. Now set \\(\\nu = 0\\), keeping all other parameter values unchanged, and recalculate the variance of Canadian output. Explain."

    "text": "Problem\nThis exercise analyzes the local stability of the equilibrium of the EDF model when the household’s subjective discount factor is assumed to be increasing in aggregate consumption, \\(\\theta'(c_t) &gt; 0\\), as opposed to decreasing, as is assumed in the baseline specification presented in section 4.10.3. Consider a small open economy populated by infinitely-lived agents. Let \\(c_t\\) denote consumption in period \\(t\\). Assume that the discount factor, denoted \\(\\beta_t\\), evolves over time according to \\(\\beta_{t+1} = \\theta(c_t)\\beta_t\\). Assume that the function \\(\\theta\\) is positive and bounded above by unity. Agents have access to international financial markets, where they can borrow or lend at the interest rate \\(r &gt; 0\\). Agents choose consumption and external debt, \\(d_t\\), so as to maximize lifetime utility given by \\(\\sum_{t=0}^\\infty \\beta_t U(c_t)\\), where \\(U(\\cdot)\\) is an increasing and strictly concave function. Agents are endowed with \\(y &gt; 0\\) units of goods each period. Agents enter period 0 with a stock \\(d_{-1}\\) of net foreign debt. Assume that \\(\\beta_0 = 1\\). Assume that households are subject to some borrowing constraint that prevents them from engaging in Ponzi schemes. Assume that agents fail to internalize that their consumption choices affect their discount factor.\n\nCharacterize the competitive equilibrium of this economy.\nCharacterize the steady state of this economy.

What properties does the function \\(\\theta(\\cdot)\\) need to have in each case to ensure that the steady state is unique? Provide an intuitive explanation for your results by comparing them to those you would obtain in an economy in which \\(\\theta(\\cdot)\\) is independent of \\(c_t\\).

That is, we are asking does there exist a solution\n\\[\nc_t = c^{ss}, \\quad d_t = d^{ss}\n\\]\nEquations (1) and (2) become\n\\[\ny + rb^{ss} = c^{ss}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + r} = \\theta(c^{ss})\n\\]\nA sufficient condition for existence and uniqueness is that \\(\\theta\\) is strictly decreasing and that \\(\\theta(0) &gt; 1/(1 + r)\\) and that \\(\\lim_{c \\to \\infty} \\theta(c) &lt; 1/(1 + r)\\). Alternatively, suppose that \\(\\theta\\) is strictly increasing, then we need that \\(\\theta(0) &lt; 1/(1 + r)\\) and that \\(\\lim_{c \\to \\infty} \\theta(c) &gt; 1/(1 + r)\\).\nIf \\(\\theta\\) was independent of \\(c_t\\) then the second steady state restriction does not give any restriction on the endogenous variables, and hence any combination of \\((c^{ss}, b^{ss})\\) that satisfies the budget constraint is a steady state. Of course, it also must be the case that \\(1 + r = \\theta\\). Else no steady state exists.\n\n\n3.\nWe have shown that a unique steady state exists. Now we will log-linearize the economy around the steady state \\((c^{ss}, b^{ss})\\). Let a hat over a variable denote percent deviations from the steady state.\n\\[\n(1 + r)\\hat{b}_{t-1} = \\frac{c^{ss}}{b^{ss}}\\hat{c}_t + \\hat{b}_t \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\epsilon_{cc} \\hat{c}_t = \\epsilon_\\theta \\hat{c}_t + \\epsilon_{cc} \\hat{c}_{t+1} \\tag{4}\n\\]\nwhere\n\\[\n\\epsilon_{cc} \\equiv \\frac{U''(c^{ss}) c^{ss}}{U'(c^{ss})} &lt; 0\n\\]\nThe inequality follows from our assumptions that the utility function is increasing and strictly concave.\n\\[\n\\epsilon_\\theta \\equiv \\frac{\\theta'(c^{ss}) c^{ss}}{\\theta(c^{ss})} &gt; 0\n\\]\nThe inequality follows from our assumption that \\(\\theta\\) is positive and increasing.\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\hat{b}_t \\\\\n\\hat{c}_{t+1}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\nM\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\hat{b}_{t-1} \\\\\n\\hat{c}_t\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\quad\n\\text{where }\nM \\equiv\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 + r & -c^{ss}/b^{ss} \\\\\n0 & 1 - \\epsilon_\\theta / \\epsilon_{cc}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThis is a system with one predetermined variable, \\(b_{t-1}\\), and one non-predetermined variable. Therefore, for local uniqueness, we need one root inside the unit circle and one outside. Since the matrix is lower triangular, its roots are:\n\\[\n\\lambda_1 = 1 + r &gt; 1\n\\]\n\\[\n\\lambda_2 = 1 - \\epsilon_\\theta / \\epsilon_{cc}\n\\]\nIt follows that no local equilibrium exists if \\(\\epsilon_\\theta &gt; 0\\), then the economy will never return to the steady state.\nSpecifically, we need:\n\\[\n\\epsilon_\\theta / \\epsilon_{cc} &lt; 2\n\\]\n\n\n4.\nHouseholds solve:\n\\[\n\\sum_{t=0}^\\infty \\beta_t U(c_t)\n\\]\nsubject to some borrowing limit and\n\\[\ny + (1 + r)b_{t-1} = c_t + b_t\n\\]\n\\[\n\\beta_{t+1} = \\theta(c_t) \\beta_t\n\\]\ntaking as exogenously given \\(y\\), \\(r\\), and the initial conditions \\(\\beta_0 = 1\\) and \\(b_{-1}\\).\nThe Lagrangian is:\n\\[\n\\mathcal{L} = \\sum_{t=0}^\\infty \\beta_t \\left\\{ U(c_t) + \\lambda_t \\left[ y + (1 + r)b_{t-1} - c_t - b_t \\right] + \\mu_t \\left[ \\theta(c_t) - \\frac{\\beta_{t+1}}{\\beta_t} \\right] \\right\\}\n\\]\nThe household chooses: \\(c_t\\), \\(b_t\\), and \\(\\beta_{t+1}\\)\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial c_t} = \\beta_t U'(c_t) - \\beta_t \\lambda_t + \\beta_t \\mu_t \\theta'(c_t) = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial b_t} = -\\beta_t \\lambda_t + \\beta_{t+1} \\lambda_{t+1}(1 + r) = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\beta_{t+1}} = U(c_{t+1}) - \\mu_t + \\beta_{t+1} \\mu_{t+1} \\frac{\\beta_{t+2}}{\\beta_{t+1}^2} = 0\n\\]\nA competitive equilibrium are sequences \\(\\{c_t, b_t, \\mu_t, \\lambda_t\\}_{t=0}^\\infty\\) satisfying for all \\(t \\geq 0\\)\n\\[\ny + (1 + r)b_{t-1} = c_t + b_t \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\lambda_t = \\theta(c_t)(1 + r)\\lambda_{t+1} \\tag{6}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\mu_t = U(c_{t+1}) + \\mu_{t+1} \\theta(c_{t+1}) \\tag{7}\n\\]\n\\[\nU'(c_t) + \\mu_t \\theta'(c_t) = \\lambda_t \\tag{8}\n\\]\ngiven \\(b_{-1}\\) and some borrowing constraint. End of definition of competitive equilibrium.\nNote: Solving forward we obtain:\n\\[\n\\mu_t = U(c_{t+1}) + \\theta(c_{t+1})[U(c_{t+2}) + \\mu_{t+2} \\theta(c_{t+2})] = \\sum_{s=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\beta_{t+s}}{\\beta_{t+1}} U(c_{t+s}) \\tag{9}\n\\]\nSo the interpretation of \\(\\mu_t\\) is the present discounted value of lifetime utility as of date \\(t+1\\).\n\n\n5.\nA steady state is the quadruple: \\(c^{ss}, b^{ss}, \\lambda^{ss}, \\mu^{ss}\\) such that\n\\[\ny + rb^{ss} = c^{ss}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + r} = \\theta(c^{ss})\n\\]\n\\[\nU'(c^{ss}) + \\mu^{ss} \\theta'(c^{ss}) = \\lambda^{ss}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\mu^{ss}(1 - \\theta(c^{ss})) = U(c^{ss})\n\\]\nFrom the second SS equation we get unique value for \\(c^{ss}\\) by the same arguments as above. From the first equation we then get a unique value for \\(b^{ss}\\). The last equation then gives a unique value of \\(\\mu^{ss}\\), and the third equation gives a unique value of \\(\\lambda^{ss}\\). Notice that the steady state value of consumption and debt is the same in the economy with internalization and without.\n\n\n6.\nUse equation (8) to eliminate \\(\\lambda_t\\), so that the complete set of equilibrium conditions are given by the following three equations\n\\[\ny + (1 + r)b_{t-1} = c_t + b_t \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\\[\nU'(c_t) + \\mu_t \\theta'(c_t) = \\theta(c_t)(1 + r) \\left[ U'(c_{t+1}) + \\mu_{t+1} \\theta'(c_{t+1}) \\right] \\tag{10}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\mu_t = U(c_{t+1}) + \\mu_{t+1} \\theta(c_{t+1}) \\tag{7}\n\\]\nNotice that the first of those three equations is just equation (1). As we have just shown the steady states are the same. Therefore the log-linearization is the same as in the external case, that is, it is given by equation (3), which after some rearranging can be written as:\n\\[\n\\hat{b}_t = (1 + r) \\hat{b}_{t-1} - \\frac{c^{ss}}{b^{ss}} \\hat{c}_t \\tag{11}\n\\]\nFurther notice that the remaining two conditions, namely, (4.10) and (4.7) do not feature \\(b_t\\). Therefore, a log-linearization of the 3 conditions is of the form\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\mu_{t+1} \\\\\n\\hat{c}_{t+1} \\\\\n\\hat{b}_t\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\nM\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\mu_t \\\\\n\\hat{c}_t \\\\\n\\hat{b}_{t-1}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\quad\n\\text{with }\nM =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nM_{11} & M_{12} & 0 \\\\\nM_{21} & M_{22} & 0 \\\\\n0 & -\\frac{c^{ss}}{b^{ss}} & 1 + r\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThis is a system of 3 equations in three unknowns. One of the unknowns is predetermined, \\(b_{t-1}\\), and two of the unknowns are not predetermined, \\(\\mu_t\\) and \\(c_t\\). Thus the equilibrium is locally unique if the matrix \\(M\\) has two roots outside of the unit circle and one root inside the unit circle. Notice that the last column of \\(M\\) is \\([0, 0; (1 + r)]\\). Hence the eigenvalues of the matrix \\(M\\) are equal to the eigenvalues of the submatrix \\(\\begin{bmatrix}\nM_{11} & M_{12} \\\\\nM_{21} & M_{22}\n\\end{bmatrix}\\)\nand \\(1 + r\\). Because \\(1 + r &gt; 1\\), for local uniqueness we need that the submatrix has one root inside the unit circle and one root outside. This can only be the case if the roots are real, for if they were complex they would be of the same modulus.\nWe next turn to finding the terms \\(M_{11}, M_{12}, M_{21}, M_{22}\\).\nLog-linearize (7) first:\n\\[\n\\hat{\\mu}_t = \\left[ \\frac{r}{1 + r} \\epsilon_c + \\frac{1}{1 + r} \\epsilon_\\theta \\right] \\hat{c}_{t+1} + \\frac{1}{1 + r} \\hat{\\mu}_{t+1} \\tag{12}\n\\]\nSolve for \\(\\hat{\\mu}_{t+1}\\):\n\\[\n\\hat{\\mu}_{t+1} = (1 + r)\\hat{\\mu}_t - \\left[ r \\epsilon_c + \\epsilon_\\theta \\right] \\hat{c}_{t+1} \\tag{13}\n\\]\nNext log-linearize equation (10):\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{r \\epsilon_c + \\epsilon_\\theta} \\left[ r \\epsilon_c \\epsilon_{cc} \\hat{c}_t + \\epsilon_\\theta \\hat{\\mu}_t + \\epsilon_\\theta \\epsilon_{\\theta\\theta} \\hat{c}_t \\right] = \\epsilon_\\theta \\hat{c}_t + \\frac{1}{r \\epsilon_c + \\epsilon_\\theta} \\left[ r \\epsilon_c \\epsilon_{cc} \\hat{c}_{t+1} + \\epsilon_\\theta \\hat{\\mu}_{t+1} + \\epsilon_\\theta \\epsilon_{\\theta\\theta} \\hat{c}_{t+1} \\right] \\tag{14}\n\\]\nMultiply both sides by \\(r \\epsilon_c + \\epsilon_\\theta\\), and use (13) to eliminate \\(\\hat{\\mu}_{t+1}\\):\n\\[\n\\left[ r \\epsilon_c \\epsilon_{cc} + \\epsilon_\\theta \\epsilon_{\\theta\\theta} \\right] \\hat{c}_t - r \\epsilon_\\theta \\hat{\\mu}_t = \\left[ r \\epsilon_c \\epsilon_{cc} + \\epsilon_\\theta \\epsilon_{\\theta\\theta} \\right] \\hat{c}_{t+1} - \\epsilon_\\theta \\left[ (1 + r)\\hat{\\mu}_t - \\left( r \\epsilon_c + \\epsilon_\\theta \\right) \\hat{c}_{t+1} \\right] \\tag{15}\n\\]\nRearrange:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\hat{c}_{t+1} = \\hat{c}_t - \\frac{r \\epsilon_\\theta}{r \\epsilon_c \\epsilon_{cc} + \\epsilon_\\theta \\epsilon_{\\theta\\theta} - (r \\epsilon_c + \\epsilon_\\theta)\\epsilon_\\theta} \\hat{\\mu}_t \\tag{17}\n}\n\\]\nThen use this expression to eliminate \\(\\hat{c}_{t+1}\\) from (13):\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\hat{\\mu}_{t+1} = -[r \\epsilon_c + \\epsilon_\\theta] \\hat{c}_t + \\left(1 + r + \\frac{r \\epsilon_\\theta (r \\epsilon_c + \\epsilon_\\theta)}{r \\epsilon_c \\epsilon_{cc} + \\epsilon_\\theta \\epsilon_{\\theta\\theta} - (r \\epsilon_c + \\epsilon_\\theta)\\epsilon_\\theta} \\right) \\hat{\\mu}_t\n}\n\\]\nLet:\n\\[\nX \\equiv \\frac{r \\epsilon_\\theta}{r \\epsilon_c \\epsilon_{cc} + \\epsilon_\\theta \\epsilon_{\\theta\\theta} - (r \\epsilon_c + \\epsilon_\\theta)\\epsilon_\\theta}\n\\]\nThen we have:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nM_{11} & M_{12} \\\\\nM_{21} & M_{22}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 + r + X (r \\epsilon_c + \\epsilon_\\theta) & -(r \\epsilon_c + \\epsilon_\\theta) \\\\\n-X & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe determinant of this matrix is:\n\\[\n\\det = 1 + r\n\\]\nIt follows that at least one eigenvalue is greater than one in modulus. Thus we either have no local solution or a unique one. But we can rule out the case of indeterminacy. Notice that this result is independent of \\(\\theta'(c)\\). The trace of this matrix is equal to\n\\[\n\\text{trace} = 1 + 1 + r + X(r \\epsilon_c + \\epsilon_\\theta)\n\\]\nNow we want to know what conditions are needed for a unique equilibrium. Let the two eigenvalues of the matrix be given by \\(\\lambda_1\\) and \\(\\lambda_2\\). Then\n\\[\n\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 = \\text{trace}\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 = \\text{determinant}\n\\]\nAs we discussed above a unique equilibrium only exists if the roots are real. Therefore, we can use a graph, the horizontal axis is \\(\\lambda_2\\) and the vertical axis measures \\(\\lambda_1\\). Plot \\(\\lambda_1 = \\det / \\lambda_2\\). If \\(\\lambda_2 = 1 + r\\), then \\(\\lambda_1 = 1\\) and if \\(\\lambda_2 = 1\\), then \\(\\lambda_1 = 1 + r\\).\nNotice that this graph is completely independent of the function \\(\\theta\\). Now plot the trace: \\(\\lambda_1 = \\text{trace} - \\lambda_2\\). This is a downward sloping line, with slope equal to minus 1 and an intercept equal to the trace.\nConsider first the case that \\(\\epsilon_\\theta = 0\\), then we have\n\\[\n\\lambda_1 = 1, \\quad \\lambda_2 = 1 + r\n\\]\nThat is, the two lines intersect at \\(\\lambda_2 = 1\\) and at \\(\\lambda_2 = 1 + r\\). In this case the system has a unit root and is therefore nonstationary.\nNow consider the case that \\(\\epsilon_\\theta \\neq 0\\). In that case the intercept changes. How does the intercept have to change to get one intersection of the two lines for \\(\\lambda_2 &lt; 1\\) and one for \\(\\lambda_2 &gt; 1\\)? If the intercept goes down, we get two intersections for \\(\\lambda_2 &gt; 1\\) and no local equilibrium exists. Therefore a necessary and sufficient condition for a locally unique equilibrium is that the intercept increases, or that:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{r \\epsilon_\\theta}{r \\epsilon_c \\epsilon_{cc} + \\epsilon_\\theta \\epsilon_{\\theta\\theta} - (r \\epsilon_c + \\epsilon_\\theta)\\epsilon_\\theta} (r \\epsilon_c + \\epsilon_\\theta) &gt; 0}\n\\]"

The volatility of output is calibrated to match the data (2.85% vs. 2.81%), and the standard deviations of consumption (1.75%) and hours worked (1.96%) are plausible and highly correlated with output.\nHowever, the model fails to generate realistic investment dynamics. The volatility of investment is only 4.59%, which is much lower than in the data, and its serial correlation is just 0.11, indicating almost no persistence. This suggests that the model lacks frictions such as capital adjustment costs.\nThe trade-balance-to-output ratio shows high persistence (0.86) and moderate volatility (0.97%), which are consistent with data from small open economies.\nOverall, the model performs well in capturing output, consumption, and external balance behavior, but does poorly in explaining investment volatility and persistence."

This increased persistence is present in the responses of output, consumption, investment and hours to shocks. The trade balance remains countercyclical. Comparing the standard deviations and correlations across models (while holding output volatility constant by construction), the AR(2) model yields more volatile consumption, significantly less volatile investment, and reduced volatility in the trade balance and current account. Serial correlation increases across all variables, as expected under a more persistent shock process. Additionally, output becomes more strongly correlated with consumption, investment, and hours worked, while its correlation with the trade balance and current account declines."

Our findings support this principle: the greater the ratio \\(E_t \\widehat{A}_{t+1} / \\widehat{A}_t\\), the more likely it is that the condition \\(\\widehat{A}_t &lt; M E_t \\widehat{A}_{t+1}\\) holds, leading to a trade deficit. Moreover, the size of the trade deficit increases with the persistence of the shock.\n\n\n9.\nIf the period utility function is separable in consumption and hours, the answers to both Questions 5 and 7 would change. In this case, the marginal utility of consumption would depend only on consumption, so when the price of contingent claims remains constant (i.e., \\(q_{0,t} = \\beta^t\\)), consumption does not respond to a temporary productivity shock. There would be neither a substitution effect nor an income effect on consumption, so consumption would remain constant. Labor supply, and hence output, would still increase following the shock, but the resulting increase in output will have to be absorbed entirely by either higher investment or a trade surplus (given the lack of an increase in consumption). Whether the trade balance deteriorates on impact will still depend on the strength of the investment response. However, since consumption no longer increases, a larger increase in investment is required to generate a trade deficit. This implies that a more persistent productivity process (i.e., a higher \\(E_t \\widehat{A}_{t+1} / \\widehat{A}_t\\)) is needed for the economy to run a trade deficit."

Specifically, assume that\n\\[\nc_t =\n\\left[\n(1-\\alpha)^{\\frac{1}{\\eta}} c_{N,t}^{1 - \\frac{1}{\\eta}} +\n\\alpha^{\\frac{1}{\\eta}} s_t^{1 - \\frac{1}{\\eta}}\n\\right]^{\\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{1}{\\eta}}},\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\eta &gt; 0\\) and \\(\\alpha \\in (0,1)\\).\nHouseholds have access to an internationally traded risk-free one-period bond, which pays the interest rate \\(r_t\\) when held between periods \\(t\\) and \\(t+1\\). The relative price of durables in terms of nondurables is one. The household is subject to a borrowing limit that prevents it from engaging in Ponzi schemes. Output, denoted \\(y_t\\), is produced with capital according to a production function of the form \\(y_t = F(k_t)\\), where \\(k_t\\) denotes physical capital. The capital stock evolves over time as\n\\[\nk_{t+1} = (1 - \\delta_k) k_t + i_t,\n\\]\nwhere \\(i_t\\) denotes investment in period \\(t\\), and \\(\\delta_k\\) is the depreciation rate on physical capital.\n\nDescribe the household’s budget set.\nState the optimization problem of the household.\nPresent the complete set of equilibrium conditions.\nThe interest rate is constant over time and equal to \\(r_t = r = \\beta^{-1} -1\\). Assume that up to period \\(-1\\), the economy was in a steady state equilibrium in which all variables were constant and \\(d=\\bar{d}&gt;0\\), where \\(d\\) denotes net external debt in the steady state. Find the share of expenditures on durables in total consumption expenditures in the steady state in terms of the parameters \\(\\delta\\), \\(r\\), \\(\\alpha\\), and \\(\\eta\\). Suggest a strategy for calibrating those four parameters.\nAssume that in period \\(0\\) the economy unexpectedly receives a positive income shock as a consequence of the rest of the world forgiving part of the country’s net foreign debt. Assume that the positive income shock results in a 1 percent increase in the consumption of nondurables in period 0. Find the percentage increase in purchases of durables and in total consumption expenditures in period 0. Compare your answer to the one you would have obtained if all consumption goods were nondurable.\nContinuing to assume that consumption of nondurables has increased by 1 percent, find the change in the trade balance in period 0 expressed as a share of steady-state consumption expenditures. Is the response of the trade balance countercyclical? Compare your findings to those you would have obtained if all consumption goods were nondurable. How much amplification is there due to the presence of durables?"

Set \\(\\beta = 1/1.04\\), \\(\\sigma = 2\\), \\(\\omega = 1.455\\), \\(\\alpha = 0.32\\), \\(\\delta = 0.10\\), and \\(\\overline{d} = 0.7442\\). Set the remaining four parameters, \\(\\rho\\), \\(\\eta\\), \\(\\phi\\), and \\(\\psi_1\\), to match the observed standard deviations and serial correlations of output and the standard deviations of investment and the trade-balance-to-output ratio in Canada during 1960–2011. Approximate the equilibrium dynamics up to first order, and use a distance minimization procedure similar to the one used in exercise 4.8. Compare the resulting values for \\(\\rho\\), \\(\\tilde{\\eta}\\), \\(\\phi\\), and \\(\\psi_1\\) with those reported in table 4.1.\nCompute theoretical second moments and present your findings as in the third panel of table 4.2.\nComment on the ability of the model to explain observed business cycles in Canada during 1960–2011.\nCompute the unconditional standard deviation of the productivity shock, \\(\\ln A_t\\), under the present calibration.

    "text": "Answer\n 📥 Download Matlab Code (4_10_code.zip) \n\n1. Calibration Results\nUsing a distance minimization procedure similar to that in Exercise 4.8, we estimate the following parameters to match the 1960–2011 Canadian moments:\n\n\\(\\rho = 0.3950\\)\n\\(\\tilde{\\eta} = 0.0118\\)\n\\(\\phi = 0.0173\\)\n\\(\\psi_1 = 0.001071\\)\n\nThese should be compared to the earlier calibration in Table 4.1. The updated values reflect the need to match more persistent and volatile output.\n\n\n2. Theoretical Second Moments\nThe model-implied second moments (standard deviations and serial correlations) are as follows:\n\n\n\nVariable\nStd. Dev.\nSerial Corr.\n\n\n\n\nOutput (\\(y\\))\n3.0826\n0.6170\n\n\nInvestment (\\(i\\))\n9.0391\n0.0686\n\n\nTrade balance / \\(y\\)\n7.9202\n0.9968\n\n\n\nThese moments are in line with the third panel of Table 4.2 for 1960–2011.\n\n\n3. Interpretation\nThe model does a reasonable job matching the key business cycle statistics. The higher persistence in the data led to a larger \\(\\rho\\) in the calibration, which increases output volatility through its effect on investment dynamics. The lower estimated \\(\\eta\\) offsets this by reducing overall shock volatility, helping the model match observed output variance.\n\n\n4. Comparison with 1946–1985 Calibration\n\nPeriod 1946–1985: \\(\\sigma_A = 0.0142\\), \\(\\sigma_y = 3.0826\\)\nPeriod 1960–2011: \\(\\sigma_A = 0.0133\\), \\(\\sigma_y = 3.7245\\)\n\nDespite a lower \\(\\sigma_A\\) in the later period, \\(\\sigma_y\\) is higher. This reflects that a more persistent shock process (higher \\(\\rho\\)) amplifies the effect of shocks on output via capital accumulation. To prevent overpredicting volatility, \\(\\eta\\) had to fall. Thus, increasing \\(\\rho\\) while reducing \\(\\eta\\) leads to higher output volatility even if technology volatility itself is lower."

You may choose to postpone working on this exercise until you have read that chapter. However, the tools developed in the current chapter should be sufficient to do this exercise.

That is, \\(A_t\\) satisfies the identity\n\\[\nA_t = C_t + I_t,\n\\]\nwhere \\(I_t\\) denotes gross domestic investment.

Compute the steady state of the model. Set \\(\\eta\\) to ensure that the share of nontraded output in total output, defined as \\(p^N_tY^N_t/(p^N_tY^N_t+Y^T_t)\\) equals 0.65 in the steady state.

Define the trade balance, \\(TB_t\\), as \\(TB_t = Y_t -C_t -I_t\\). Compute the unconditional standard deviations of the growth rates of consumption and output, defined, respectively, as \\(\\Delta C_t \\equiv \\log(C_t/C_{t-1})\\) and \\(\\Delta Y_t \\equiv \\log(Y_t/Y_{t-1})\\).

Answer the previous two questions under your proposed parameterization.\nBased on your answers to the previous three questions, evaluate the ability of the present traded-nontraded model to explain key stylized facts in emerging countries.

This result, however, was derived in the context of a model driven by technology shocks. The present exercise aims to establish whether this finding is robust to assuming that business cycles are driven by world-interest-rate shocks.\n\nConsider the external debt-elastic interest-rate (EDEIR) model of Section 4.1.1 of Chapter 4. Shut down the productivity shock by setting \\(\\widetilde{\\eta}=0\\). Replace equation (4.14) with\n\\[\nr_t = r^*_t + p(\\widetilde{d}_t),\n\\]\nand\n\\[\nr^*_t  = r^* + \\xi (r^*_{t-1} - r^*) + \\mu_t,\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\mu_t \\sim N(0,\\sigma_{\\mu}^2)\\).

Using this version of the EDEIR model, compute the statistics considered in Table 4.4 and make a table. Make a figure showing impulse responses of output, consumption, hours, investment, the trade-balance-to-output ratio, and the current-account-to-output ratio implied by the EDEIR model driven by interest-rate shocks. Provide intuition for these results.\nNow consider the internal discount factor (IDF) model of Section 4.10.4. Again, set \\(\\widetilde{\\eta}=0\\).

Calibrate \\(\\psi_3\\) as in Section 4.10.4. Use the resulting calibrated model to compute unconditional second moments and impulse responses. Provide intuition for your results. To facilitate comparison, place the information generated here in the same table and figure produced in the previous question.\nCompare the predictions of the EDEIR and IDF models driven by interest rate shocks.

    "text": "Problem\nThe SVAR evidence presented in Section 7.4 suggests that the terms of trade play a small role in explaining business cycles in emerging and poor countries. Some have argued that for commodity exporting countries world commodity prices can be an important driver of aggregate activity. To test this hypothesis, consider the case of Chile, a country for which about half of its exports are concentrated in a single commodity, namely, copper. The present exercise consists in replacing the terms of trade with the real price of copper in the SVAR analysis of Section 7.4. To this end, download the time series of the spot price of copper in dollars at the London Market at an annual frequency from the IMF-IFS dataset. Deflate this series using the U.S. CPI index. Remove a quadratic time trend from the natural logarithm of the real copper price. Use the raw data corresponding to Chile contained in the file data_annual.xls (posted with the materials for Chapter 1) for the remaining four variables of the SVAR. Apply the same detrending and transformations of the variables as in the body of the chapter. Then estimate the SVAR system, equations(7.8) and (7.9), for Chile with your commodity price index taking the place of \\(tot_t\\). The sample should be 1980 to 2011. Plot impulse responses of all variables in the SVAR to a ten-percent copper-price increase. Finally, estimate the share of the variance of each variable in the SVAR system explained by copper price shocks. Discuss your findings and compare them to those reported in Section 7.4(especially Table 7.2) for the case of Chile. Is the price of copper a more important driver of Chilean business cycles than the Chilean terms of trade?"

    "text": "Problem\nAn important problem of the MX model of Section 7.5 is that it exaggerates the role of the terms of trade relative to the predictions of the empirical SVAR model. Consider the possibility of bringing model and data closer together by introducing delays in the process of capital accumulation. Here, the hope is that if building capital takes time, terms-of-trade shocks may not induce large increases in investment because by the time investment becomes capital, much of the shock might have faded away (recall that the cross-country median value of \\(\\rho\\), implying a half life of terms-of-trade shocks is only one year). Specifically, assume that investment goods take \\(i\\) years rather than one year to become productive capital, that is, model the law of motion of the capital stocks as\n\\[\nk^j_{t+1} = (1-\\delta)k^j_t + i^j_{t-i},\n\\]\nfor \\(j=m,x\\).

Now, for each value of \\(i\\), compute the predicted variances of output, consumption, investment, and the trade balance due to terms of trade shocks.

    "text": "Problem\nContinuing with the theme of the previous two exercises, one possible explanation behind the mismatch between the predictions of the theoretical and empirical models regarding the importance of terms-of-trade shocks is the presence of trade tariffs. To the extent that trade taxes move systematically in the opposite direction as the terms of trade, the domestic relative price of exportables and importables will be insensitive to movements in their world counterparts, which, in turn, may attenuate the effects of terms-of-trade shocks on domestic activity. Continue to assume that \\(p^x_t\\) and \\(p^m_t\\) denote the domestic prices of exportables and importables, respectively, in terms of final goods, and that \\(tot_t\\equiv p^x_t/p^m_t\\) denotes the domestic terms of trade. The novelty in the present setting is that there is a tax that introduces a wedge, denoted \\(\\gamma_t\\), between the domestic and the foreign terms of trade. Specifically, assume that\n\\[\ntot_t = tot^*_t \\gamma_t,\n\\]\nwhere \\(tot^*_t\\) denotes the foreign terms of trade. The wedge \\(\\gamma_t\\) is one minus a proportional trade barrier, which might take the form of a combination of import and export taxes. As before, the country takes the evolution of the foreign terms of trade as given. Assume that \\(tot^*_t\\) follows the AR(1) process\n\\[\n\\ln\\left(\n\\frac{tot^*_t}\n{tot^*}\\right)\n= \\rho \\ln\n\\left(\\frac{tot^*_{t-1}}\n{tot^*}\\right)\n+ \\pi \\epsilon^{tot*}_t,\n\\]\nwhere \\(tot^*\\) denotes the steady-state value of \\(tot^*_t\\). Assume that the government increases taxes on exports (or reduces taxes on imports) when the foreign terms of trade improves. Specifically, assume that\n\\[\n\\gamma_t = \\left(\\frac{tot^*_t}{tot^*}\\right)^{-\\eta},\n\\]\nwith \\(\\eta&gt;0\\). Finally, assume that the government rebates the proceeds of trade taxes to households in a lump-sum fashion. Calibrate the model using the values for the structural parameters given in Table 7.5 and the cross-country medians of \\(\\rho\\), \\(\\pi\\), \\(\\phi\\), and \\(\\psi\\), given in Tables 7.1 and 7.4. Consider different values of \\(\\eta\\) ranging from 0 to 1. For each value of \\(\\eta\\) compute the variances of output, consumption, investment, and the trade balance due to terms-of-trade shocks. Discuss your results."

Hint: All of these equilibrium values are functions of the initial level of debt and of the structural parameters of the model.\nCharacterize the effect of an increase in the initial level of debt, \\(d_0\\), on consumption of tradables and nontradables, sectoral employment, and the real exchange rate. Provide intuition.\nWe say that the economy de-industrializes when the share of employment allocated to the tradable sector falls permanently.

Derive \\(\\bar{d}_0\\) as a function of the structural parameters of the model. The country’s net debt position can be driven below \\(\\bar{d}_0\\) by a sequence of temporary shocks of any nature. When a sequence of possibly temporary shocks causes a permanent decline in the size of a large productive sector of the economy we say that the economy suffered a case of Dutch Disease. More specifically, economist refer to Dutch disease when the temporary shocks are linked to commodity prices and the sector that shrinks is the industrial or manufacturing sector.\nSuppose now that \\(d_0\\) is such that the economy is completely de-industrialized. Derive the equilibrium level of the real exchange rate. Discuss intuitively how \\(d_0\\) affects the real exchange rate under these circumstances.

    "text": "Problem\nDornbusch’s (1976) celebrated exchange-rate overshooting result states that an unanticipated monetary expansion causes a larger depreciation of the nominal exchange rate in the short run than in the long run. The present exercise aims to ascertain whether the neo-Keynesian model of Section 9.16 captures this effect. To this end, assume that monetary policy is neither a currency peg nor the optimal exchange-rate policy (the two polar cases analyzed in Section~ 9.16) but instead takes the form of the following Taylor-type interest-rate feedback rule:\n\\[\n\\hat{i}_t = 1.5 \\hat{\\pi}_t + 0.125 \\hat{y}_t + \\eta_t,\n\\]\nwhere \\(i_t\\) denotes the gross domestic nominal interest rate, \\(\\pi_t\\) denotes the gross consumer price inflation rate, and \\(y_t\\), denotes real output. As before, a hat over a variable denotes log-deviation from the deterministic steady state. The variable \\(\\eta_t\\) denotes an exogenous monetary-policy shock and is assumed to be i.i.d. with mean zero and standard deviation \\(\\sigma_{\\eta}\\). Note that the variables \\(i_t\\), \\(\\pi_t\\), and \\(y_t\\) were not defined in the model of Section 9.16, so you have to properly define these variables and derive additional equilibrium conditions linking them to the variables of the original model. For example, for \\(i_t\\) assume that households have access to a nominally risk-free one-period bond and derive the household’s first-order condition associated with holdings of this bond. Use a log-linearized version of the model calibrated as in Section 9.16. Plot the impulse response of the devaluation rate, \\(\\epsilon_t\\), to a 1 percentage-point decline in \\(\\eta_t\\). We would say that the model captures the overshooting effect if \\(\\hat{\\epsilon}_t\\) initially jumps up and later falls below zero and converges to its steady-state value from below.

At the same time if \\(\\underline{r}&gt;r\\), then the partial derivative is positive and a further increase in \\(\\underline{r}\\) is also welfare increasing. For the purpose of this exercise, we are interested in the partial derivative of welfare for the case that \\(\\underline{r}&lt;r\\).\nWhat about the DNWR economy? Note that\n\\[\nW^{dnwr} = W^f + \\frac{\\beta}{1-\\beta} \\ln \\left(\n\\frac{1+\\underline{r}}\n{1+r}\n\\right)^{\\alpha}\n\\]\nIt follows that\n\\[\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\frac{\\partial W^{dnwr}}{\\partial(1+\\underline{r})}\n&=&\n\\frac{\\partial W^{f}}{\\partial(1+\\underline{r})}\n+ \\alpha \\frac{\\beta}{1-\\beta} \\frac{1}{1+\\underline{r}}\n\\\\\n&=&\n\\frac1r \\, \\frac1{1+\\underline{r}}  - \\frac1r \\,  \n\\frac{1+r}{1+\\underline{r}}  \n\\frac{1}{1  +\n\\frac{r (1+\\underline{r})}{(1+r)}}\n+ \\alpha \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{1}{1+\\underline{r}}\n\\\\\n&=&\n\\frac1r \\, \\frac1{1+\\underline{r}}\n\\left[\n(1 + \\alpha)  -\n\\frac{(1+r)}{1  +\n\\frac{r (1+\\underline{r})}{(1+r)}}\n\\right]\n\\end{eqnarray*}\n\\]\nIf \\(\\underline{r}=r\\), then\n\\[\n\\left.\n\\frac{\\partial W^{dnwr}}{\\partial(1+\\underline{r})} \\right\\vert_{\\underline{r}=r}\n&gt;0\n\\]\nIt follows that a temporary decline in the interest rate is welfare decreasing. [Recall that under optimal policy the partial derivative was zero. so that a temporary interest rate decline was NOT welfare decreasing.]\nIf \\(\\underline{r}&lt;r\\), then\n\\[\n\\left.\n\\frac{\\partial W^{dnwr}}{\\partial(1+\\underline{r})} \\right\\vert_{\\underline{r}&lt;r}\n=\n\\frac1r \\, \\frac1{1+\\underline{r}}\n\\left[\n(1 + \\alpha)  -\n\\frac{(1+r)}{1  +\n\\frac{r (1+\\underline{r})}{(1+r)}}\n\\right]\n\\]\nwhich is positive as long as\n\\[\n\\alpha &gt; r  \\frac{1-\\frac{(1+\\underline{r})}{(1+r)}}{1+ r \\frac{(1+\\underline{r})}{1+r}}\n\\]\nA sufficient condition therefore is that\n\\[\n\\alpha &gt;r\n\\]\nwhich should be true for the labor share is larger than the rate of interest. Thus we have shown that it can be the case that the fall in interest rates is welfare decreasing in the DNWR economy. As we will see in chapter 10, this result is the reason why capital control taxes can be welfare increasing in this economy. The interest rate decline stimulates current absorption. This drives up wages in period 0. When the rates go back up, domestic absorption falls. For full employment we need lower real wages then. But with a peg and DNWR real wages cannot come back down, so we get unemployment instead. A social planner might be willing to impose a capital control tax that households do not take advantage of the temporarily lower rates and do not borrow that much more. and this would make agents better off because it would prevent wages from rising that high."

    "text": "Answer\nStart by making a graphical analysis. Keep in mind that \\(c_t\\) and \\(d_{t+1}\\) is independent of monetary policy and the wage rigidity. Then do the algebra.\nFirst recall that with DNWR the solution as given in Section 9.2.3 was:\n\\[\nh_0 = 1 ;\\quad \\mbox{ and } c^N_0 = 1\n\\]\n\\[\nw_t = \\alpha c^T_0&gt;\\alpha y^T=w_{-1}\n\\]\nfor all \\(t\\ge 0\\).\n\\[\np_0=c^T_0&gt;y^T=p_{-1}\n\\]\n\\[\nh_t=\n\\frac{1+\\underline{r}}{1+r}&lt;1.\n\\]\nfor all \\(t\\ge 1\\)\n\\[\nc^N_t = \\left(\\frac{1+\\underline{r}}{1+r}\\right)^{\\alpha }&lt;1\n\\]\nand finally\n\\[\np_t = \\frac{c^T_t}{c^N_t} =\\frac{y^T \\left[\\frac{1}{1+r} +\\frac{r}{1+r} \\frac{1+\\underline{r}}{1+r}\\right]}{\\left(\\frac{1+\\underline{r}}{1+r}\\right)^{\\alpha }}\n\\]\nNow characterize the economy’s response to the temporary decline in the interest rate under the assumption of full wage rigidity, that is, under the assumption that \\(W_t = W_{t-1}\\) for all \\(t\\ge0\\). Continue to assume that for a given wage, the equilibrium level of hours is the minimum between the supply of hours and the demand for hours.\nTraded allocations are the same as they are independent of the wage rigidity because intra temp elast is the same as inter temp elast.\nNow what will happen in the NT sector?\nSince wages don’t move there will be excess demand for labor. Hence we have\n\\[\nh_0 = 1 ;\\quad \\mbox{ and } c^N_0 = 1\n\\]\n\\[\nw_t = w_{-1}\n\\]\nfor all \\(t\\ge 0\\). In period 0, there is a real appreciation\n\\[\np_0=c^T_0&gt;y^T=p_{-1}\n\\]\nFrom period 1 onward traded absorption is smaller than in period 0 and, more importantly, smaller than in the steady state prior to period 0. Why? Because the economy enters period 1 with debt, \\(d_1&gt;0\\), and hence must use some of its traded endowment to service the external debt. Therefore the full employment wage is lower than the period-0 wage\n\\[\nw^{full}_1 = c^T_1 \\alpha &lt;  \\alpha y^T = w_{1}\n\\]\nSince wages are inflexible\n\\[\nw_t = w_{-1}  \n\\]\nfor all \\(t\\). At that wage hours solve\n\\[\nh^{fixed}_t = c^T_t \\alpha / (w_t) = \\alpha c^T_t / \\alpha y^T = \\frac{c^T_t}{y^T_t} =\n\\left[\\frac1{1+r} + \\frac{r}{1+r} \\frac{1+\\underline{r}}{1+r}\\right]&lt;1\n\\]\nIt follows that the fixed wage economy also suffers involuntary unemployment from period 1 onwards.\nFinally show that welfare is higher under full wage rigidity than under only downward wage rigidity.\nWe have just shown that the eqm for \\(c^T_t\\) and for \\(h_0\\) is the same in the dnwr and the fixed wage economy.\nWelfare in the DNWR economy:\n\\[\nW^{dnwr} = \\ln c^T_0 + \\frac{\\beta}{1-\\beta} \\ln c^T_1 + \\alpha \\ln h_0 + \\frac{\\alpha \\beta}{1-\\beta} \\ln h_1^{dnwr}\n\\]\nWelfare in the fixed wage economy:\n\\[\nW^{fixed} = \\ln c^T_0 + \\frac{\\beta}{1-\\beta} \\ln c^T_1 + \\alpha \\ln h_0 + \\frac{\\alpha \\beta}{1-\\beta} \\ln h_1^{fixed}\n\\]\nThus we have that:\n\\[\nW^{fixed}-W^{dnwr}   \\frac{\\alpha \\beta}{1-\\beta} \\left[ \\ln h_1^{fixed} - \\ln h_1^{dnwr} \\right]\n\\]\nWelfare will be higher is employment from period 1 onwards is higher in the fixed wage economy. To see that this is indeed the case: Recall\n\\[\nh^{fixed}_t = c^T_t \\alpha / (w_t) = \\alpha c^T_t / \\alpha y^T = \\frac{c^T_t}{y^T_t} =\n\\left[\\frac1{1+r} + \\frac{r}{1+r} \\frac{1+\\underline{r}}{1+r}\\right]&lt;1\n\\]\nCompare that to the case of only downward wage rigidity\n\\[\nh^{dnwr}_t = \\frac{1+\\underline{r}}{1+r}&lt;1.\n\\]\nfor all \\(t\\ge 1\\)\nNotice that \\(h^{fixed}_t\\) is a weighted average between 1 and \\(h^{dnwr}&lt;1\\) with weights that add up to one, namely, $1/(1+r) $ on 1 and weight \\(r/(1+r)\\) on \\(h^{dnwr}\\). Therefore we have that\n\\[\n\\fbox{$1&gt; h^{fixed} &gt; h^{dnwr}&gt;0$}\n\\]\nThis says that in the fixed wage economy there is also unemployment but less unemployment than in the DNWR economy.\nIt then follows immediately, that welfare is higher in the fixed wage economy than in the dnwr economy, under a temporary interest rate decline.\nWhy is this so? Because under fixed wages, wages do not rise during the boom phase, period 0, and hence when aggregate demand slows beginning in period 1, the real wage is not that high, and with a lower past wage employment, given lower demand, can be higher. To put it into more general language due to the externality, if wage rigidity is stronger, then wages never rise to a level that curtails future employment by as much as it would had wages risen."

    "text": "Answer\nBecause nominal rigidity is the only friction in the present model, it should be intuitive that if we were to remove this friction, the resulting competitive equilibrium would coincide with the Pareto optimal allocation for any exchange-rate policy. To see this formally, set \\(\\gamma=0\\). Then, equilibrium condition~(\\(\\ref{eq:dnwr_DNWR-competitive}\\)) collapses to \\(w_t\\ge0\\). This condition is superfluous because, by condition (\\(\\ref{eq:dnwr_labor-demand-competitive}\\)) and the fact that \\(p_t\\) and \\(F'(h_t)\\) are both positive, we have that \\(w_t&gt;0\\).
