In addition, each period \\(t = 0, 1, \\ldots\\) the household is endowed with an exogenous and stochastic amount of goods \\(y_t\\).

    "text": "Problem\nThroughout this chapter, we have studied small open economies in which the world interest rate is given. This exercise aims at illustrating the forces determining this variable.\nConsider a two-period world composed of a continuum of countries indexed by \\(i \\in [0, 1]\\). Each country is populated by a large number of identical households with preferences given by\n\\[\n\\ln(c_{i1}) + \\beta \\ln(c_{i2}),\n\\]\nwhere \\(c_{i1}\\) and \\(c_{i2}\\) denote consumption of a perishable good in country \\(i\\) in periods 1 and 2, respectively, and \\(\\beta \\in (0, 1)\\) is the subjective discount factor. Households start period 1 with a nil net debt position. In period 1, they can borrow or lend in the international financial market via a debt instrument, denoted \\(d_{i1}\\), that matures in period 2 and carries the interest rate \\(r\\). The interest rate \\(r\\) is exogenous to each country \\(i\\).\nIn period 1, each household receives an endowment of goods \\(y_{i1} = y_1 + \\varepsilon_i\\), where \\(y_1\\) is the world component of the endowment and \\(\\varepsilon_i\\) is a country-specific component satisfying\n\\[\n\\int_0^1 \\varepsilon_i di = 0.\n\\]\nIn period 2, the endowment has no idiosyncratic component and is given by \\(y_{i2} = y_2\\). Finally, households are subject to a no-Ponzi-game constraint that forbids them to end period 2 with a positive debt position, that is, they are subject to the constraint \\(d_{i2} \\leq 0\\), where \\(d_{i2}\\) denotes the debt assumed in period 2.\n\nWrite down and solve the household’s optimization problem in country \\(i\\), given \\(r\\).\nDerive the equilibrium levels of the trade balance, the current account, and external debt in periods 1 and 2 in country \\(i\\) given \\(r\\).\nWrite down the world resource constraints in periods 1 and 2.\nDerive the equilibrium level of the world interest rate, \\(r\\).\nSuppose now that output in period 1 in country \\(i\\) increases by \\(x &gt; 0\\), that is, \\(\\Delta y_{i1} = x\\).

The interest rate falls to make consumption tomorrow more costly and making it optimal to consume tomorrow less than will be consumed today.\nIn the reverse case, the interest rate is high to make consumption today more costly and make it optimal to consume more tomorrow.\nNote that in this case only “shocks to the aggregate income” matter for the value of the interest rate and whether the consumption is perfectly smoothed across periods.\n\n\n5.\nTwo cases:\n(a) The world interest rate does not depend on the country-level shocks, therefore, the interest rate stays the same.\nRecall from the previous section that country-level debt can be expressed as:\n\\[\nd_1^i = - \\frac{\\beta \\varepsilon_1^i}{1 + \\beta}\n\\]\nThat means that if country-specific component increases, external debt decreases.\nSince:\n\\[\ntb_1^i = ca_1^i = -d_1^i = \\frac{\\beta \\varepsilon_1^i}{1 + \\beta}\n\\]\nTrade balance and current account both increase.\n(b) consider the equation for the world interest rate:\n\\[\nr = \\frac{y_2}{\\beta y_1} - 1\n\\]\nThe world interest rate depends negatively on \\(y_1\\), therefore, it will decrease when \\(y_1\\) increases.\nThe external debt of a country \\(i\\) is given by:\n\\[\nd_1^i = \\frac{1}{(1 + r)(1 + \\beta)} \\left( y_2^i - \\beta(1 + r)y_1^i \\right)\n\\]\nReplace the interest rate in terms of aggregate income to obtain:\n\\[\nd_1^i = - \\frac{\\beta \\varepsilon_1^i}{1 + \\beta}\n\\]\nTherefore, country debt will not change.\n\\[\ntb_1^i = ca_1^i = -d_1^i = \\frac{\\beta \\varepsilon_1^i}{1 + \\beta}\n\\]\nTrade balance and current account will not change as well.\nComparison: When the world component of the output increases, the whole world would like to save to ensure consumption smoothing. However, because there is no additional demand for funds, the interest rate goes down to ensure that the world market for savings clears. Consumption in period 2 becomes more expensive and consumers find it optimal consume all the additional income.\nIn the case of the country-specific shock, only one country wants to save more. All the countries are infinitely small, so there is no impact on the world interest rate."

    "text": "Problem\nIn Chapter 1, we showed that two empirical regularities that characterize emerging economies are the countercyclicality of the trade balance-to-output ratio and the fact that consumption growth appears to be more volatile than output growth. In this chapter, we developed a simple small open endowment economy and provided intuitive arguments suggesting that this economy fails to account for these two stylized facts. However, that model does not allow for closed-form solutions of second moments of output growth, consumption growth, or the trade balance-to-output ratio. The goal of this exercise is to obtain these implied statistics numerically.\nTo this end, consider the following parameterization of the model developed in the present chapter:\n\\[\ny_t - \\bar{y} = \\rho(y_{t-1} - \\bar{y}) + \\epsilon_t,\n\\]\nwith \\(\\rho=0.9\\), \\(\\bar{y}=1\\), and \\(\\epsilon_t\\) is distributed normally with mean 0 and standard deviation 0.03. Note that the parameter \\(\\bar{y}\\), which earlier in this chapter was implicitly assumed to be zero, represents the deterministic steady state of the output process. Assume further that \\(r=\\frac{1}{\\beta}-1=0.1\\), \\(d_{-1}=\\bar{y}/2\\), and \\(y_{-1}=\\bar{y}\\).\n\nSimulate the economy for 100 years.\nDiscard the first 50 years of artificial data to minimize the dependence of the results on initial conditions.\nCompute the growth rates of output and consumption and the trade balance-to-output ratio.\nCompute the sample standard deviations of output growth and consumption growth and the correlation between output growth and the trade balance-to-output ratio.

In fact debt turns into assets and then grows without bounds but at a rate less that \\(r\\).\nAsymptotically the growth rate of assets (\\(-d_t\\)) is\n\\[\n\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{(-d_t) - (-d_{t-1})}{-d_{t-1}} = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\left[ 1 - \\left( \\frac{\\gamma}{1 + \\gamma} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1 + r}{r} \\right) \\right] \\left( \\frac{y - r d_{t-1}}{-d_{t-1}} \\right)\n= r \\left[ 1 - \\left( \\frac{\\gamma}{1 + \\gamma} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1 + r}{r} \\right) \\right]\n\\]\nwhich uses \\(\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} y / d_{t-1} = 0\\) because \\(-d_{t-1}\\) increases without bound.\nThe gross growth rate of \\(-d_t\\) is equal to \\(1 + r \\left[ 1 - \\left( \\frac{\\gamma}{1 + \\gamma} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1 + r}{r} \\right) \\right] = (1 + r) / (1 + \\gamma) &lt; 1 + r\\).\nThe growth rate of consumption is \\(\\beta^{-1} = (1 + r)/(1 + \\gamma)\\), which is the same as the asymptotic growth rate of assets.\n\n\n5.\nStep 1: Change in consumption in period 0\n\\[\n\\Delta c_0 = \\left( \\frac{\\gamma}{1 + \\gamma} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1 + r}{r} \\right) \\Delta y &lt; \\Delta y\n\\]\nbecause \\(\\left( \\frac{\\gamma}{1 + \\gamma} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1 + r}{r} \\right) &lt; 1\\).\nThis follows from \\(\\beta = (1 + \\gamma)/(1 + r) &lt; 1\\).\nIn words \\(c_0\\) increases but by less than \\(y\\).\nStep 2:\n\\[\n\\Delta tb_0 = \\Delta y - \\Delta c_0 = \\left[ 1 - \\left( \\frac{\\gamma}{1 + \\gamma} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1 + r}{r} \\right) \\right] \\Delta y &gt; 0\n\\]\nThis means that a permanent increase in the level of income leads to an increase in the trade balance.\nUnder the preferences used in class, namely, time separable and no impatience, we obtained the result that the trade balance was unchanged.\nWhat is the intuition? With Leontief preferences and agents more patient than the market (\\(\\beta &gt; 1/(1 + \\gamma)\\)) households have an increasing path of consumption over time and to achieve this given that the increase in income is flat (or non-increasing over time), the only way to fund an increasing consumption path is to save more in period 0 and then to use only part of the additional interest income for additional consumption and using the remainder to save.\n\n\n6.\nWhen \\(\\gamma = 0\\), no equilibrium with positive lifetime utility exists."

This internalization is absent under external habits, so household consume more in period 1 under the latter formulation.\nIt is of interest to note that period-1 consumption is lower under external habits than under no habits.

Specifically, the new path of the interest rate is\n\\[\nr'_t =\n\\begin{cases}\nr_t & \\text{for all } t \\geq 0 \\text{ and } t \\neq t^* \\\\\nr'_{t^*} &lt; r_{t^*} & \\text{for } t = t^*\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nFind the impact effect of this anticipated interest rate cut on consumption, that is, find \\(\\ln (c'_0 / c_0)\\), where \\(c'_t\\) denotes the equilibrium path of consumption under the new interest rate path and \\(c_t\\) denotes the equilibrium path of consumption under the old interest rate path. Distinguish two cases. First consider a storage economy with \\(y_t = 0\\) for all \\(t\\) and \\(b_{-1} &gt; 0\\). Discuss whether the anticipated future rate cut stimulates demand at the time it is announced. Provide intuition. Then consider an endowment economy with \\(b_{-1} = 0\\) and \\(y_t = y &gt; 0\\) for all \\(t\\). Analyze whether the response of consumption in period 0 is equal in size to the anticipated rate cut and whether it depends on the anticipation horizon \\(t^*\\). In particular, do anticipated interest rate cuts have a smaller stimulating effect on current consumption the further in the future they will take place, that is, the larger \\(t^*\\) is? Provide intuition for your findings.\nRelate the insights obtained in this exercise to the debate on Forward Guidance as a monetary policy strategy. In particular, interpret the present real economy as a monetary economy with rigid nominal prices and a central bank that deploys the necessary monetary policy to fully control the real interest rate \\(r_t\\). Address in particular the question of whether forward guidance is an effective tool to stimulate aggregate demand."

    "text": "Answer\n\n1.\nThe PVBC is\n\\[\n\\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{c_{t+j}}{\\prod_{s=0}^{j-1}(1 + r_{t+s})} \\right) = b_{t-1} + \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{y_{t+j}}{\\prod_{s=0}^{j-1}(1 + r_{t+s})} \\right), \\tag{1}\n\\]\nwhich says that the PDV of consumption is equal to the sum of the initial asset position and the PDV of the endowment stream. Note that \\(\\prod_{s=0}^{-1} (1 + r_{t+s})\\) represents the empty product because the lower bound \\(s = 0\\) is greater than the upper bound \\(s = -1\\). By convention, an empty product (a product over an empty index set) is defined to be 1.\n\n\n2.\nTo derive the equilibrium paths we first write the Lagrangian for the consumer\n\\[\n\\mathcal{L} = \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\beta^t \\left\\{ \\ln c_t + \\lambda_t \\left[ y_t + b_{t-1} - c_t - \\frac{b_t}{1 + r_t} \\right] \\right\\}.\n\\]\nThis Lagrangian has first order conditions with respect to \\(c_t\\) and \\(b_{t+1}\\) respectively\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{c_t} = \\lambda_t\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{\\lambda_t}{1 + r_t} = \\beta \\lambda_{t+1}.\n\\]\nAn equilibrium is paths \\(\\{c_t, b_t\\}_{t=0}^{\\infty}\\) such that for all \\(t \\geq 0\\) we have the combined first order conditions, sequential budget constraint, and the no-Ponzi game condition\n\\[\nc_{t+1} = \\beta(1 + r_t)c_t \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nc_t + \\frac{b_t}{1 + r_t} = y_t + b_{t-1} \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\lim_{j \\to \\infty} \\frac{b_{t+j}}{\\prod_{s=0}^j (1 + r_{t+s})} = 0 \\tag{4}\n\\]\ngiven \\(\\{r_t\\}_{t=0}^{\\infty}\\), \\(\\{y_t\\}_{t=0}^{\\infty}\\), and \\(b_{-1}\\).\nEquivalently, equilibrium is a \\(c_0\\) such that\n\\[\nc_0 = (1 - \\beta)b_{-1} + (1 - \\beta) \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{y_t}{\\prod_{s=0}^{t-1}(1 + r_s)} \\right). \\tag{5}\n\\]\nTo see this, iterate (2) backwards to obtain\n\\[\nc_t = \\beta^t \\left( \\prod_{s=0}^{t-1} (1 + r_s) \\right) c_0. \\tag{6}\n\\]\nRearranging yields\n\\[\n\\frac{c_t}{\\prod_{s=0}^{t-1}(1 + r_s)} = \\beta^t c_0.\n\\]\nNow sum both sides from \\(t=0\\) to \\(t=T\\)\n\\[\n\\sum_{t=0}^{T} \\frac{c_t}{\\prod_{s=0}^{t-1}(1 + r_s)} = \\sum_{t=0}^{T} \\beta^t c_0\n\\]\nTake limit for \\(T \\rightarrow \\infty\\)\n\\[\n\\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{c_t}{\\prod_{s=0}^{t-1}(1 + r_s)} = \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\beta^t c_0 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta}c_0\n\\]\nNext use this expression in equation (1) evaluated for \\(t = 0\\) to obtain\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 - \\beta}c_0 = b_{-1} + \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{y_t}{\\prod_{s=0}^{t-1}(1 + r_s)} \\right)\n\\]\nFinally, multiply by \\((1− \\beta)\\), which yields the equation (5).\nHow to find the associated path of \\(b_t\\) and \\(c_t\\)? Use (3) evaluated at \\(t = 0\\). This gives \\(b_0\\). Then use (5) evaluated at \\(t = 0\\). This gives \\(c_1\\). With \\(b_0\\) and \\(c_1\\) in hand evaluate (3) for \\(t = 1\\) to obtain \\(b_1\\). Continue in this way to construct the sequences \\(\\{c_t\\}_{t=0}^{\\infty}\\) and \\(\\{b_t\\}_{t=0}^{\\infty}\\).\n\n\n3.\nStorage economy, \\(y = 0\\) and \\(b_{-1} &gt; 0\\)\n\\[\n\\frac{c_t'}{c_t} =\n\\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{for all } t \\leq t^* \\\\\n\\left( \\frac{1 + r_{t^*}'}{1 + r_{t^*}} \\right) &lt; 1 & \\text{for all } t &gt; t^*\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nThis shows that the anticipated future rate cut does not stimulate demand at the time it is announced. Importantly, there is no effect on current consumption regardless of the anticipation horizon \\(t^*\\). But the rate cut will permanently lower future consumption starting from the period it takes place. Intuition: The rate cut has a SE whereby current consumption rises and future consumption falls. But it also has an IE. Here the IE is negative because the positive stock of bonds will pay lower interest in the future. With log utility, the SE exactly cancels the IE effect and the future rate cut fails to stimulate the current economy.\nEndowment Economy: \\(y_t = y &gt; 0\\) for all \\(t\\) and \\(b_{-1} = 0\\).\nLet\n\\[\nq_{0,t} \\equiv \\prod_{s=0}^{t-1} (1 + r_s); \\quad \\text{and } q_{0,t}' = \\prod_{s=0}^{t-1} (1 + r_s')\n\\]\nUse (5) to obtain\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nc_0 &= (1 - \\beta) \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{y_t}{q_{0,t}} \\right) \\\\\n&= (1 - \\beta) \\sum_{t=0}^{t^*} \\left( \\frac{y_t}{q_{0,t}} \\right) + (1 - \\beta) \\sum_{t = t^* + 1}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{y_t}{q_{0,t}} \\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nc_0' &= (1 - \\beta) \\sum_{t = 0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{y_t}{q_{0,t}'} \\right) \\\\\n&= (1 - \\beta) \\sum_{t = 0}^{t^*} \\left( \\frac{y_t}{q_{0,t}} \\right) + (1 - \\beta) \\cdot \\frac{1 + r_{t^*}}{1 + r_{t^*}'} \\sum_{t = t^* + 1}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{y_t}{q_{0,t}} \\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nso that\n\\[\nc_0' - c_0 = (1 - \\beta) \\sum_{t = t^* + 1}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{y_t}{q_{0,t}} \\right) \\left[ \\frac{1 + r_{t^*}}{1 + r_{t^*}'} - 1 \\right] &gt; 0\n\\]\nWhat is different now? Why does consumption go up on impact in response to the future rate cut? There is a positive IE associated with the expected future rate cut. Why? Because of the rate cut in \\(t^*\\), the PDV of endowment stream is higher. Thus, the SE and the IE reinforce each other for \\(t \\leq t^*\\) and pull in opposite directions for \\(t &gt; t^*\\).\nSize of increase in consumption for \\(t \\leq t^*\\) now depends on \\(t^*\\). The further in the future is the rate cut, the smaller is the positive IE and hence the smaller is increase in demand.\n\n\n4.\nBy contrast in the NK model, increase in consumption depends only on size of rate cut, but not on anticipation horizon, i.e., a rate cut in 100 years has same power as a rate cut in 1 year from now and hence there is no Forward Guidance puzzle. In the current environment Forward Guidance is a less effective tool to stimulate the economy than in the NK model."

The first-order condition associated with this problem is\n\\[\n\\beta^t c_t^{-1} = \\lambda (1 + r)^{-t},\n\\]\nfor \\(t \\geq 0\\), where \\(\\lambda\\) is an endogenously determined constant. This expression implies that\n\\[\n\\frac{c_{t+1}}{c_t} = \\beta(1 + r) &lt; 1,\n\\]\nfor \\(t \\geq 0\\), which, in turn, implies that\n\\[\n\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} c_t = 0.\n\\]\nPlugging these two results in the intertemporal resource constraint derived above gives\n\\[\n0 = \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} (1 + r)^{-t} \\left\\{ y - [\\beta(1 + r)]^t c_0 \\right\\}\n= y \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} (1 + r)^{-t} - c_0 \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\beta^t\n= \\frac{1 + r}{r} y - \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta} c_0,\n\\]\nwhich implies the following solution for the initial level of consumption:\n\\[\nc_0 = (1 - \\beta) \\frac{1 + r}{r} y &gt; y.\n\\]\nRecall that \\(y\\) is the constant equilibrium path of consumption under the more standard assumption \\(\\beta(1 + r) = 1\\). Thus, summing up, we have that when \\(\\beta(1 + r) &lt; 1\\), consumption is initially higher than its equilibrium value under the assumption \\(\\beta(1 + r) = 1\\), and then gradually falls to zero at the gross rate \\(\\beta(1 + r) &lt; 1\\).\nIntuitively, households in this economy are impatient relative to the market discount factor \\(1/(1 + r)\\), and, as a result, consume a lot at the beginning and nothing at the ‘end’ of their never-ending lives. A story similar to that in the 1995 movie Leaving Las Vegas, but in infinite horizon.\n\n\n2.\nIn period 0, we have that\n\\[\nd_0 = c_0 - y = \\frac{y}{r} - \\beta \\frac{1 + r}{r} y.\n\\]\nWe calculated before that \\(c_0 &gt; y\\), so we have that \\(d_0 &gt; 0 = d_{-1}\\). Thus, debt increases in period 0.\nNow consider the long run. Taking the limit of the left- and right-hand sides of the sequential resource constraint for \\(t \\to \\infty\\), we get\n\\[\n\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} d_t = (1 + r) \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} d_t + \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} c_t - y.\n\\]\nRecalling that \\(\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} c_t = 0\\), we obtain\n\\[\n\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} d_t = \\frac{y}{r} &gt; d_0.\n\\]\nThe long-run value of debt is higher than its value in period 0. It can be shown that the convergence is monotonic and dictated by the equation\n\\[\nd_t = \\frac{y}{r} \\left\\{ 1 - [\\beta(1 + r)]^{t+1} \\right\\}.\n\\]\nThe proof is by induction. We already showed that it holds for \\(t = 0\\), that is,\n\\[\nd_0 = \\left\\{ 1 - [\\beta(1 + r)]^{1+0} \\right\\} \\frac{y}{r}.\n\\]\nSuppose it holds for an arbitrary \\(t \\geq 0\\), then we need to show it also holds for \\(t + 1\\). By the budget constraint:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nd_{t+1} &= (1 + r) d_t + c_{t+1} - y \\\\\n&= (1 + r) d_t + \\beta^{t+1} (1 + r)^{t+1} (1 - \\beta) \\frac{1 + r}{r} y - y \\\\\n&= (1 + r) \\left[ 1 - \\beta^{t+1}(1 + r)^{t+1} \\right] \\frac{y}{r} + \\beta^{t+1} (1 + r)^{t+2} (1 - \\beta) \\frac{y}{r} - y \\\\\n&= \\left[ 1 - \\beta^{t+1}(1 + r)^{t+2} \\right] \\frac{y}{r} + \\beta^{t+1} (1 + r)^{t+2} (1 - \\beta) \\frac{y}{r} \\\\\n&= \\left[ 1 - \\beta^{t+2} (1 + r)^{t+2} \\right] \\frac{y}{r}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nSuppose one had been unsure that debt converges to a constant, the above solution for \\(d_t\\) also shows it.\n\n\n3.\nThe trade balance is defined as \\(tb_t = y - c_t\\). The initial trade balance is negative, since, as shown above, \\(c_0 &gt; y\\). Since consumption is monotonically decreasing, we have that the trade balance improves monotonically. At some point it turns into a surplus. In the long run, the trade balance equals the endowment \\(y\\)."

It says that after deteriorating in period 0, the trade balance improves to a level higher than in the original steady state.\nThe stock of debt increases in period 0. To see this, write\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nd_0 &= (1 + r) d_{-1} - tb_0 \\\\\n&= (1 + r) d_{-1} - tb_{-1} - (tb_0 - tb_{-1}) \\\\\n&= d_{-1} - (tb_0 - tb_{-1}) \\\\\n&&gt; d_{-1}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nsince \\(tb_0 - tb_{-1} &lt; 0\\). Because the trade balance is constant (and equal to \\(tb''\\)) from period 1 on, we have that the evolution of debt satisfies\n\\[\nd_t = (1 + r) d_{t-1} - tb''; \\quad t \\geq 1\n\\]\nThe only nonexplosive solution to this expression is\n\\[\nd_t = d_0; \\quad t \\geq 1\n\\]\nwhich means that\n\\[\ntb'' = r d_0 &gt; r \\bar{d}\n\\]\nThis explains the last line of (*). Summarizing,\n\\[\nd_t =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\bar{d} & t &lt; 0 \\\\\nd' &gt; \\bar{d} & t = 0 \\\\\nd'' &gt; \\bar{d} & t &gt; 0\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nThe current account, being the change in the stock of debt, is negative in period 0 and 0 thereafter,\n\\[\nca_t =\n\\begin{cases}\n0 & t &lt; 0 \\\\\n-(d' - \\bar{d}) &lt; 0 & t = 0 \\\\\n0 & t &gt; 0\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n\n2.\nThe key difference is that under a permanent but anticipated increase in productivity, output does not increase in period 0. This is because at \\(t = 0\\) \\(A_t\\) and \\(k_t\\) are still at their old values \\(\\bar{A}\\) and \\(\\bar{k}\\). In the unanticipated case, by contrast, \\(A_0 = A' &gt; \\bar{A}\\) and \\(k_0 = \\bar{k}\\), so output increases in period 0. Besides this, the two cases are similar in the sense that in period 0 consumption and investment increase, and the trade balance deteriorates.\n\n\n3.\n\n(a)\nFrom the equilibrium condition \\(k_{t+1} = \\kappa(A_{t+1}/r)\\), we have that \\(k_t = \\bar{k} \\equiv \\kappa(\\bar{A}/r)\\) for \\(t \\leq 0\\), \\(k_1 = k' \\equiv \\kappa(A'/r)\\), and \\(k_t = \\bar{k}\\) for \\(t &gt; 1\\). So we have that\n\\[\nk_t =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\bar{k} & t &lt; 0 \\\\\n\\bar{k} & t = 0 \\\\\nk' &gt; \\bar{k} & t = 1 \\\\\n\\bar{k} & t &gt; 1\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\\[\ni_t =\n\\begin{cases}\n0 & t &lt; 0 \\\\\nk' - \\bar{k} &gt; 0 & t = 0 \\\\\n\\bar{k} - k' &lt; 0 & t = 1 \\\\\n0 & t &gt; 1\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\\[\ny_t =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\bar{A}F(\\bar{k}) & t &lt; 0 \\\\\n\\bar{A}F(\\bar{k}) & t = 0 \\\\\nA'F(k') &gt; y_0 & t = 1 \\\\\n\\bar{A}F(\\bar{k}) & t &gt; 1\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nFrom the intertemporal resource constraint and the fact that \\(c_t = c_0\\) for all \\(t\\) we have:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nrd_{-1} + c_0 &= \\frac{r}{1 + r} \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{A_t F(k_t) - (k_{t+1} - k_t)}{(1 + r)^t}\\\\\n&= \\frac{r}{1 + r} \\left[ \\left( \\frac{1 + r}{r} \\right) \\bar{A}F(\\bar{k}) + \\frac{1}{1 + r}(A'F(k') - \\bar{A}F(\\bar{k})) - (k' - \\bar{k}) + \\frac{1}{1 + r}(k' - \\bar{k}) \\right]\\\\\n&= \\bar{A}F(\\bar{k}) + \\frac{r}{(1 + r)^2} \\left[ A'F(k') - \\bar{A}F(\\bar{k}) - r(k' - \\bar{k}) \\right]\\\\\n&= \\bar{A}F(\\bar{k}) + \\frac{r}{(1 + r)^2} \\left[ A'F(k') - \\bar{A}F(\\bar{k}) - A'F'(k')(k' - \\bar{k}) \\right]\\\\\n&= rd_{-1} + c_{-1} + \\frac{r}{(1 + r)^2} \\left[ A'F(\\bar{k}) - \\bar{A}F(\\bar{k}) + A'F(k') - A'F(\\bar{k})- A'F'(k')(k' - \\bar{k}) \\right]\\\\\n&&gt; rd_{-1} + c_{-1}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhich implies that\n\\[\nc_0 &gt; c_{-1}\n\\]\nthat is, consumption jumps up in period 0 and stays at that higher level thereafter. Comparing this derivation with the one for an anticipated permanent productivity shock, it is clear that the increase in consumption is now smaller. The trade balance deteriorates in period 0. To see this, write\n\\[\ntb_0 - tb_{-1} = (y_0 - y_{-1}) - (c_0 - c_{-1}) - (i_0 - i_{-1})\n\\]\nand note that \\(y_0 - y_{-1} = 0\\), \\(c_0 - c_{-1} &gt; 0\\), and \\(i_0 &gt; 0\\). The deterioration in the trade balance is smaller than in the case in which the anticipated productivity shock is permanent, because now the increase in consumption is smaller. In period 1 the trade balance improves:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ntb_1 - tb_0 &= (y_1 - y_0) - (c_1 - c_0) - (i_1 - i_0) \\\\\n&= A'F(k') - \\bar{A}F(\\bar{k}) + 2(k' - \\bar{k}) \\\\\n&&gt; 0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIn period 2 the trade balance deteriorates because output falls from \\(A'F(k')\\) to \\(\\bar{A}F(\\bar{k})\\), and investment goes from negative to zero:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ntb_2 - tb_1 &= (y_2 - y_1) - (c_2 - c_1) - (i_2 - i_1) \\\\\n&= \\bar{A}F(\\bar{k}) - A'F(k') - (k' - \\bar{k}) \\\\\n&&lt; 0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nAs we will see shortly, the trade balance in period 2 is lower than in the original steady state. From period 2 on, output is constant and equal to \\(\\bar{A}F(\\bar{k})\\), consumption is constant and equal to \\(c_0\\), and investment is zero, so the trade balance is constant and equal to \\(\\bar{A}F(\\bar{k}) - c_0 &lt; \\bar{A}F(\\bar{k}) - c_{-1} = tb_{-1} = r\\bar{d}\\). Summarizing,\n\\[\ntb_t =\n\\begin{cases}\nrd_{-1} & t &lt; 0 \\\\\ntb' &lt; rd_{-1} & t = 0 \\\\\ntb'' &gt; tb' & t = 1 \\\\\nrd_{-1} &lt; tb'' & t &gt; 1\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nThe stock of debt increases in period 0. To see this, write\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nd_0 &= (1 + r)d_{-1} - tb_0 \\\\\n&= (1 + r)d_{-1} - tb_{-1} - (tb_0 - tb_{-1}) \\\\\n&= d_{-1} - (tb_0 - tb_{-1}) \\\\\n&&gt; d_{-1}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nsince \\(tb_0 &lt; tb_{-1}\\). In period 1, debt falls to a level lower than in the original steady state. To see this, recall that the trade balance is constant from period 2 on, so the evolution of debt satisfies\n\\[\nd_t = (1 + r)d_{t-1} - tb_2, \\quad t \\geq 2\n\\]\nwhich means that the only nonexplosive solution is\n\\[\nd_t = d_1 = tb_2 / r = (\\bar{A}F(\\bar{k}) - c_0)/r &lt; (\\bar{A}F(\\bar{k}) - c_{-1})/r = tb_{-1}/r = d_{-1} = \\bar{d},\n\\]\nfor \\(t \\geq 1\\). So we can write\n\\[\nd_t =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\bar{d} & t &lt; 0 \\\\\nd' &gt; \\bar{d} & t = 0 \\\\\nd'' &lt; \\bar{d} & t &gt; 0\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nThe current account, being the change in the stock of debt, is negative in period 0, positive in period 1, and 0 thereafter,\n\\[\nca_t =\n\\begin{cases}\n0 & t &lt; 0 \\\\\n-(d' - \\bar{d}) &lt; 0 & t = 0 \\\\\n-(d'' - d') &gt; 0 & t = 1 \\\\\n0 & t &gt; 1\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n\n(b)\nThe key diﬀerence is in the trade balance and the current account. Both deteriorate when the temporary shock is anticipated but improve when it is unanticipated. This is primarily because in the former case in period 0 investment increases and output is unchanged, whereas in the latter case investment is unchanged and output increases.\n\n\n(c)\nAn anticipated endowment shock would also cause a deterioration in the trade balance and the current account in period 0, because output is unchanged but consumption increases (as households feel richer). However, the deterioration in the external accounts is smaller, because in the economy with capital investment is a second source of increase in domestic absorption."

First find the intertemporal budget constraint as\n\\[\n\\sum_{t = 0}^{\\infty} \\frac{A_t^{1 - \\alpha} K_t^{\\alpha} + K_t - K_{t + 1} - C_t}{(1 + r)^t} = (1 + r) D_{-1}\n\\]\nExpress in terms of \\(k_t\\) and \\(c_t\\):\n\\[\n\\sum_{t = 0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\gamma^t}{(1 + r)^t} \\left[ k_t^{\\alpha} + k_t - \\gamma k_{t + 1} - c_0 \\right] = (1 + r) D_{-1} / A_0\n\\]\nWe know the time path of \\(k_t\\). Therefore the above intertemporal budget constraint represents one equation in one unknown, \\(c_0\\). Solve for \\(c_0\\):\n\\[\nk_0^{\\alpha} + k_0 - \\gamma k_1 + \\frac{\\gamma}{1 + r - \\gamma} \\left[ k_1^{\\alpha} + k_1 - \\gamma k_1 \\right] = (1 + r) D_{-1} / A_0 + \\frac{1 + r}{1 + r - \\gamma} c_0\n\\]\nWith \\(k_0\\) and \\(k_1\\) known, we can solve for \\(c_0\\). We then also have found \\(C_t = \\gamma^t A_0 c_0\\) for all \\(t \\geq 0\\). \\(K_{t+1} = k_1 A_{t+1} = k_1 \\gamma^{t+1} A_0\\) ; \\(Y_t = k_t^{\\alpha} \\gamma^t A_0\\).

    "text": "Problem\nConsider a world with two economies, Canada and the United States, indexed by \\(i=Can,US\\), respectively. Suppose that both economies are populated by a large number of identical households with preferences given by\n\\[\nE_0 \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty}\n\\beta^t \\frac{\\left[\nc^i_t - \\frac{\n(h^i_t)^{\\omega}}{\\omega}\\right]^{1-\\sigma} - 1}{1 - \\sigma},\n\\]\nwhere \\(c^i_t\\) and \\(h^i_t\\) denote, respectively, consumption and hours worked in country \\(i\\) in period \\(t\\). In both countries, households operate a technology that produces output, denoted \\(y^i_t\\), using labor and capital, denoted \\(k^i_t\\). The production technology is Cobb-Douglas and is given by\n\\[\ny^i_t = A^i_t (k^i_t)^{\\alpha} (h^i_t)^{1-\\alpha},\n\\]\nwhere \\(A^i_t\\) denotes a productivity shock in country \\(i\\), which evolves according to the following AR(1) process:\n\\[\n\\ln A^i_{t+1} = \\rho^i \\ln A^i_t + \\eta^i \\epsilon^i_{t+1},\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\epsilon^i_t\\) is an i.i.d. innovation with mean zero and variance one, and \\(\\rho^i\\) and \\(\\eta^i\\) are country-specific parameters. Both countries produce the same good. The evolution of capital obeys the following law of motion:\n\\[\nk^i_{t+1} = k^i_t + \\frac{1}{\\phi^i} \\left[ \\left( \\frac{i^i_t}{\\delta k^i_t} \\right)^{\\phi^i} - 1 \\right] \\delta k^i_t,\n\\]\nwhere \\(i^i_t\\) denotes investment in country \\(i\\), and \\(\\phi^i\\) is a country-specific parameter.\nAssume that asset markets are complete and that there exists free mobility of goods and financial assets between the United States and Canada, but that labor and installed capital are immobile across countries. Finally, assume that Canada has measure zero relative to the United States, so that the latter can be modeled as a closed economy.\nConsider the business cycle regularities for Canada for the period 1960–2011 shown in Exercise 4.10. The following table displays observed standard deviations, serial correlations, and correlations with output for the United States for 1960–2011. The data are annual and are expressed in per capita terms. The series \\(y\\), \\(c\\), and \\(i\\) are in logs, and the series \\(tb/y\\) is in levels. All series were quadratically detrended. Standard deviations are measured in percentage points.\n\nSource: Own calculations based on data from World Development Indicators.\n\nCalibrate the model as follows. Assume that the deterministic steady-state levels of consumption per capita are the same in Canada and the United States. Set \\(\\beta = 1/1.04\\), \\(\\sigma = 2\\), \\(\\omega = 1.455\\), \\(\\alpha = 0.32\\), and \\(\\delta = 0.10\\). Set the remaining six parameters, \\(\\rho^i\\), \\(\\eta^i\\), and \\(\\phi^i\\), for \\(i = \\text{Can, US}\\), to match the observed standard deviations and serial correlations of output and the standard deviations of investment in Canada and the United States. Use a distance minimization procedure as in exercise 4.8.\nApproximate the equilibrium dynamics up to first order. Produce the theoretical counterparts of the two tables showing Canadian and U.S. business-cycle regularities.\nComment on the ability of the model to explain observed business cycles in Canada and the United States.\nPlot the response of Canadian output, consumption, investment, hours, and the trade-balance-to-output ratio to a unit innovation in the Canadian productivity shock. On the same plot, show the response of the Canadian variables to a unit innovation to the U.S. productivity shock. Discuss the differences in the responses to a domestic and a foreign technology shock and provide intuition.\nCompare, by means of a graph and a discussion, the predicted responses of Canada and the United States to a unit innovation in the U.S. productivity shock. The graph should include the same variables as the one for the previous question.\nCompute the fraction of the volatilities of Canadian output and the trade-balance-to-output ratio explained by the U.S. productivity shock according to the present model. To this end, set \\(\\eta^{\\text{Can}} = 0\\), and compute the two standard deviations of interest. Then take the ratio of these standard deviations to their respective counterparts when both shocks are active.\nThis question aims to quantify the importance of common shocks as drivers of the U.S.–Canadian business cycle. Replace the process for the Canadian productivity shock with the following one:\n\n\\[\n\\ln A^{\\text{Can}}_{t+1} = \\rho^{\\text{Can}} \\ln A^{\\text{Can}}_t + \\eta^{\\text{Can}} \\epsilon^{\\text{Can}}_{t+1} + \\nu \\epsilon^{\\text{US}}_{t+1}.\n\\]\nAll other aspects of the model are as before. Recalibrate the model using an augmented version of the strategy described above that includes an additional parameter, \\(\\nu\\), and an additional target, the cross-country correlation of output, which in the sample used here is 0.64. Report the new set of calibrated parameters. Compute the variance of Canadian output. Now set \\(\\nu = 0\\), keeping all other parameter values unchanged, and recalculate the variance of Canadian output. Explain."

Consider a small open economy populated by infinitely-lived agents. Let \\(c_t\\) denote consumption in period \\(t\\). Assume that the discount factor, denoted \\(\\beta_t\\), evolves over time according to \\(\\beta_{t+1} = \\theta(c_t)\\beta_t\\). Assume that the function \\(\\theta\\) is positive and bounded above by unity. Agents have access to international financial markets, where they can borrow or lend at the interest rate \\(r &gt; 0\\). Agents choose consumption and external debt, \\(d_t\\), so as to maximize lifetime utility given by \\(\\sum_{t=0}^\\infty \\beta_t U(c_t)\\), where \\(U(\\cdot)\\) is an increasing and strictly concave function. Agents are endowed with \\(y &gt; 0\\) units of goods each period. Agents enter period 0 with a stock \\(d_{-1}\\) of net foreign debt. Assume that \\(\\beta_0 = 1\\).

What properties does the function \\(\\theta(\\cdot)\\) need to have in each case to ensure that the steady state is unique?

That is, we are asking does there exist a solution\n\\[\nc_t = c^{ss}, \\quad d_t = d^{ss}\n\\]\nEquations (1) and (2) become\n\\[\ny + rb^{ss} = c^{ss}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + r} = \\theta(c^{ss})\n\\]\nA sufficient condition for existence and uniqueness is that \\(\\theta\\) is strictly decreasing and that \\(\\theta(0) &gt; 1/(1 + r)\\) and that \\(\\lim_{c \\to \\infty} \\theta(c) &lt; 1/(1 + r)\\). Alternatively, suppose that \\(\\theta\\) is strictly increasing, then we need that \\(\\theta(0) &lt; 1/(1 + r)\\) and that \\(\\lim_{c \\to \\infty} \\theta(c) &gt; 1/(1 + r)\\).\nIf \\(\\theta\\) was independent of \\(c_t\\) then the second steady state restriction does not give any restriction on the endogenous variables, and hence any combination of \\((c^{ss}, b^{ss})\\) that satisfies the budget constraint is a steady state. Of course, it also must be the case that \\(1 + r = \\theta\\). Else no steady state exists.\n\n\n3.\nWe have shown that a unique steady state exists. Now we will log-linearize the economy around the steady state \\((c^{ss}, b^{ss})\\). Let a hat over a variable denote percent deviations from the steady state.\n\\[\n(1 + r)\\hat{b}_{t-1} = \\frac{c^{ss}}{b^{ss}}\\hat{c}_t + \\hat{b}_t \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\epsilon_{cc} \\hat{c}_t = \\epsilon_\\theta \\hat{c}_t + \\epsilon_{cc} \\hat{c}_{t+1} \\tag{4}\n\\]\nwhere\n\\[\n\\epsilon_{cc} \\equiv \\frac{U''(c^{ss}) c^{ss}}{U'(c^{ss})} &lt; 0\n\\]\nThe inequality follows from our assumptions that the utility function is increasing and strictly concave.\n\\[\n\\epsilon_\\theta \\equiv \\frac{\\theta'(c^{ss}) c^{ss}}{\\theta(c^{ss})} &gt; 0\n\\]\nThe inequality follows from our assumption that \\(\\theta\\) is positive and increasing.\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\hat{b}_t \\\\\n\\hat{c}_{t+1}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\nM\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\hat{b}_{t-1} \\\\\n\\hat{c}_t\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\quad\n\\text{where }\nM \\equiv\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 + r & -c^{ss}/b^{ss} \\\\\n0 & 1 - \\epsilon_\\theta / \\epsilon_{cc}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThis is a system with one predetermined variable, \\(b_{t-1}\\), and one non-predetermined variable. Therefore, for local uniqueness, we need one root inside the unit circle and one outside. Since the matrix is lower triangular, its roots are:\n\\[\n\\lambda_1 = 1 + r &gt; 1\n\\]\n\\[\n\\lambda_2 = 1 - \\epsilon_\\theta / \\epsilon_{cc}\n\\]\nIt follows that no local equilibrium exists if \\(\\epsilon_\\theta &gt; 0\\), then the economy will never return to the steady state.\nSpecifically, we need:\n\\[\n\\epsilon_\\theta / \\epsilon_{cc} &lt; 2\n\\]\n\n\n4.\nHouseholds solve:\n\\[\n\\sum_{t=0}^\\infty \\beta_t U(c_t)\n\\]\nsubject to some borrowing limit and\n\\[\ny + (1 + r)b_{t-1} = c_t + b_t\n\\]\n\\[\n\\beta_{t+1} = \\theta(c_t) \\beta_t\n\\]\ntaking as exogenously given \\(y\\), \\(r\\), and the initial conditions \\(\\beta_0 = 1\\) and \\(b_{-1}\\).\nThe Lagrangian is:\n\\[\n\\mathcal{L} = \\sum_{t=0}^\\infty \\beta_t \\left\\{ U(c_t) + \\lambda_t \\left[ y + (1 + r)b_{t-1} - c_t - b_t \\right] + \\mu_t \\left[ \\theta(c_t) - \\frac{\\beta_{t+1}}{\\beta_t} \\right] \\right\\}\n\\]\nThe household chooses: \\(c_t\\), \\(b_t\\), and \\(\\beta_{t+1}\\)\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial c_t} = \\beta_t U'(c_t) - \\beta_t \\lambda_t + \\beta_t \\mu_t \\theta'(c_t) = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial b_t} = -\\beta_t \\lambda_t + \\beta_{t+1} \\lambda_{t+1}(1 + r) = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\beta_{t+1}} = U(c_{t+1}) - \\mu_t + \\beta_{t+1} \\mu_{t+1} \\frac{\\beta_{t+2}}{\\beta_{t+1}^2} = 0\n\\]\nA competitive equilibrium are sequences \\(\\{c_t, b_t, \\mu_t, \\lambda_t\\}_{t=0}^\\infty\\) satisfying for all \\(t \\geq 0\\)\n\\[\ny + (1 + r)b_{t-1} = c_t + b_t \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\lambda_t = \\theta(c_t)(1 + r)\\lambda_{t+1} \\tag{6}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\mu_t = U(c_{t+1}) + \\mu_{t+1} \\theta(c_{t+1}) \\tag{7}\n\\]\n\\[\nU'(c_t) + \\mu_t \\theta'(c_t) = \\lambda_t \\tag{8}\n\\]\ngiven \\(b_{-1}\\) and some borrowing constraint. End of definition of competitive equilibrium.\nNote: Solving forward we obtain:\n\\[\n\\mu_t = U(c_{t+1}) + \\theta(c_{t+1})[U(c_{t+2}) + \\mu_{t+2} \\theta(c_{t+2})] = \\sum_{s=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\beta_{t+s}}{\\beta_{t+1}} U(c_{t+s}) \\tag{9}\n\\]\nSo the interpretation of \\(\\mu_t\\) is the present discounted value of lifetime utility as of date \\(t+1\\).\n\n\n5.\nA steady state is the quadruple: \\(c^{ss}, b^{ss}, \\lambda^{ss}, \\mu^{ss}\\) such that\n\\[\ny + rb^{ss} = c^{ss}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + r} = \\theta(c^{ss})\n\\]\n\\[\nU'(c^{ss}) + \\mu^{ss} \\theta'(c^{ss}) = \\lambda^{ss}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\mu^{ss}(1 - \\theta(c^{ss})) = U(c^{ss})\n\\]\nFrom the second SS equation we get unique value for \\(c^{ss}\\) by the same arguments as above. From the first equation we then get a unique value for \\(b^{ss}\\). The last equation then gives a unique value of \\(\\mu^{ss}\\), and the third equation gives a unique value of \\(\\lambda^{ss}\\). Notice that the steady state value of consumption and debt is the same in the economy with internalization and without.\n\n\n6.\nUse equation (8) to eliminate \\(\\lambda_t\\), so that the complete set of equilibrium conditions are given by the following three equations\n\\[\ny + (1 + r)b_{t-1} = c_t + b_t \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\\[\nU'(c_t) + \\mu_t \\theta'(c_t) = \\theta(c_t)(1 + r) \\left[ U'(c_{t+1}) + \\mu_{t+1} \\theta'(c_{t+1}) \\right] \\tag{10}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\mu_t = U(c_{t+1}) + \\mu_{t+1} \\theta(c_{t+1}) \\tag{7}\n\\]\nNotice that the first of those three equations is just equation (1). As we have just shown the steady states are the same. Therefore the log-linearization is the same as in the external case, that is, it is given by equation (3), which after some rearranging can be written as:\n\\[\n\\hat{b}_t = (1 + r) \\hat{b}_{t-1} - \\frac{c^{ss}}{b^{ss}} \\hat{c}_t \\tag{11}\n\\]\nFurther notice that the remaining two conditions, namely, (4.10) and (4.7) do not feature \\(b_t\\). Therefore, a log-linearization of the 3 conditions is of the form\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\mu_{t+1} \\\\\n\\hat{c}_{t+1} \\\\\n\\hat{b}_t\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\nM\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\mu_t \\\\\n\\hat{c}_t \\\\\n\\hat{b}_{t-1}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\quad\n\\text{with }\nM =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nM_{11} & M_{12} & 0 \\\\\nM_{21} & M_{22} & 0 \\\\\n0 & -\\frac{c^{ss}}{b^{ss}} & 1 + r\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThis is a system of 3 equations in three unknowns. One of the unknowns is predetermined, \\(b_{t-1}\\), and two of the unknowns are not predetermined, \\(\\mu_t\\) and \\(c_t\\). Thus the equilibrium is locally unique if the matrix \\(M\\) has two roots outside of the unit circle and one root inside the unit circle. Notice that the last column of \\(M\\) is \\([0, 0; (1 + r)]\\). Hence the eigenvalues of the matrix \\(M\\) are equal to the eigenvalues of the submatrix \\(\\begin{bmatrix}\nM_{11} & M_{12} \\\\\nM_{21} & M_{22}\n\\end{bmatrix}\\)\nand \\(1 + r\\). Because \\(1 + r &gt; 1\\), for local uniqueness we need that the submatrix has one root inside the unit circle and one root outside. This can only be the case if the roots are real, for if they were complex they would be of the same modulus.\nWe next turn to finding the terms \\(M_{11}, M_{12}, M_{21}, M_{22}\\).\nLog-linearize (7) first:\n\\[\n\\hat{\\mu}_t = \\left[ \\frac{r}{1 + r} \\epsilon_c + \\frac{1}{1 + r} \\epsilon_\\theta \\right] \\hat{c}_{t+1} + \\frac{1}{1 + r} \\hat{\\mu}_{t+1} \\tag{12}\n\\]\nSolve for \\(\\hat{\\mu}_{t+1}\\):\n\\[\n\\hat{\\mu}_{t+1} = (1 + r)\\hat{\\mu}_t - \\left[ r \\epsilon_c + \\epsilon_\\theta \\right] \\hat{c}_{t+1} \\tag{13}\n\\]\nNext log-linearize equation (10):\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{r \\epsilon_c + \\epsilon_\\theta} \\left[ r \\epsilon_c \\epsilon_{cc} \\hat{c}_t + \\epsilon_\\theta \\hat{\\mu}_t + \\epsilon_\\theta \\epsilon_{\\theta\\theta} \\hat{c}_t \\right] = \\epsilon_\\theta \\hat{c}_t + \\frac{1}{r \\epsilon_c + \\epsilon_\\theta} \\left[ r \\epsilon_c \\epsilon_{cc} \\hat{c}_{t+1} + \\epsilon_\\theta \\hat{\\mu}_{t+1} + \\epsilon_\\theta \\epsilon_{\\theta\\theta} \\hat{c}_{t+1} \\right] \\tag{14}\n\\]\nMultiply both sides by \\(r \\epsilon_c + \\epsilon_\\theta\\), and use (13) to eliminate \\(\\hat{\\mu}_{t+1}\\):\n\\[\n\\left[ r \\epsilon_c \\epsilon_{cc} + \\epsilon_\\theta \\epsilon_{\\theta\\theta} \\right] \\hat{c}_t - r \\epsilon_\\theta \\hat{\\mu}_t = \\left[ r \\epsilon_c \\epsilon_{cc} + \\epsilon_\\theta \\epsilon_{\\theta\\theta} \\right] \\hat{c}_{t+1} - \\epsilon_\\theta \\left[ (1 + r)\\hat{\\mu}_t - \\left( r \\epsilon_c + \\epsilon_\\theta \\right) \\hat{c}_{t+1} \\right] \\tag{15}\n\\]\nRearrange:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\hat{c}_{t+1} = \\hat{c}_t - \\frac{r \\epsilon_\\theta}{r \\epsilon_c \\epsilon_{cc} + \\epsilon_\\theta \\epsilon_{\\theta\\theta} - (r \\epsilon_c + \\epsilon_\\theta)\\epsilon_\\theta} \\hat{\\mu}_t \\tag{17}\n}\n\\]\nThen use this expression to eliminate \\(\\hat{c}_{t+1}\\) from (13):\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\hat{\\mu}_{t+1} = -[r \\epsilon_c + \\epsilon_\\theta] \\hat{c}_t + \\left(1 + r + \\frac{r \\epsilon_\\theta (r \\epsilon_c + \\epsilon_\\theta)}{r \\epsilon_c \\epsilon_{cc} + \\epsilon_\\theta \\epsilon_{\\theta\\theta} - (r \\epsilon_c + \\epsilon_\\theta)\\epsilon_\\theta} \\right) \\hat{\\mu}_t\n}\n\\]\nLet:\n\\[\nX \\equiv \\frac{r \\epsilon_\\theta}{r \\epsilon_c \\epsilon_{cc} + \\epsilon_\\theta \\epsilon_{\\theta\\theta} - (r \\epsilon_c + \\epsilon_\\theta)\\epsilon_\\theta}\n\\]\nThen we have:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nM_{11} & M_{12} \\\\\nM_{21} & M_{22}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 + r + X (r \\epsilon_c + \\epsilon_\\theta) & -(r \\epsilon_c + \\epsilon_\\theta) \\\\\n-X & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe determinant of this matrix is:\n\\[\n\\det = 1 + r\n\\]\nIt follows that at least one eigenvalue is greater than one in modulus. Thus we either have no local solution or a unique one. But we can rule out the case of indeterminacy. Notice that this result is independent of \\(\\theta'(c)\\). The trace of this matrix is equal to\n\\[\n\\text{trace} = 1 + 1 + r + X(r \\epsilon_c + \\epsilon_\\theta)\n\\]\nNow we want to know what conditions are needed for a unique equilibrium. Let the two eigenvalues of the matrix be given by \\(\\lambda_1\\) and \\(\\lambda_2\\). Then\n\\[\n\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 = \\text{trace}\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 = \\text{determinant}\n\\]\nAs we discussed above a unique equilibrium only exists if the roots are real. Therefore, we can use a graph, the horizontal axis is \\(\\lambda_2\\) and the vertical axis measures \\(\\lambda_1\\). Plot \\(\\lambda_1 = \\det / \\lambda_2\\). If \\(\\lambda_2 = 1 + r\\), then \\(\\lambda_1 = 1\\) and if \\(\\lambda_2 = 1\\), then \\(\\lambda_1 = 1 + r\\).\nNotice that this graph is completely independent of the function \\(\\theta\\). Now plot the trace: \\(\\lambda_1 = \\text{trace} - \\lambda_2\\). This is a downward sloping line, with slope equal to minus 1 and an intercept equal to the trace.\nConsider first the case that \\(\\epsilon_\\theta = 0\\), then we have\n\\[\n\\lambda_1 = 1, \\quad \\lambda_2 = 1 + r\n\\]\nThat is, the two lines intersect at \\(\\lambda_2 = 1\\) and at \\(\\lambda_2 = 1 + r\\). In this case the system has a unit root and is therefore nonstationary.\nNow consider the case that \\(\\epsilon_\\theta \\neq 0\\). In that case the intercept changes. How does the intercept have to change to get one intersection of the two lines for \\(\\lambda_2 &lt; 1\\) and one for \\(\\lambda_2 &gt; 1\\)? If the intercept goes down, we get two intersections for \\(\\lambda_2 &gt; 1\\) and no local equilibrium exists. Therefore a necessary and sufficient condition for a locally unique equilibrium is that the intercept increases, or that:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{r \\epsilon_\\theta}{r \\epsilon_c \\epsilon_{cc} + \\epsilon_\\theta \\epsilon_{\\theta\\theta} - (r \\epsilon_c + \\epsilon_\\theta)\\epsilon_\\theta} (r \\epsilon_c + \\epsilon_\\theta) &gt; 0}\n\\]"

The volatility of output is calibrated to match the data (2.85% vs. 2.81%), and the standard deviations of consumption (1.75%) and hours worked (1.96%) are plausible and highly correlated with output.\nHowever, the model fails to generate realistic investment dynamics. The volatility of investment is only 4.59%, which is much lower than in the data, and its serial correlation is just 0.11, indicating almost no persistence. This suggests that the model lacks frictions such as capital adjustment costs.\nThe trade-balance-to-output ratio shows high persistence (0.86) and moderate volatility (0.97%), which are consistent with data from small open economies.\nOverall, the model performs well in capturing output, consumption, and external balance behavior, but does poorly in explaining investment volatility and persistence."

This increased persistence is present in the responses of output, consumption, investment and hours to shocks. The trade balance remains countercyclical. Comparing the standard deviations and correlations across models (while holding output volatility constant by construction), the AR(2) model yields more volatile consumption, significantly less volatile investment, and reduced volatility in the trade balance and current account. Serial correlation increases across all variables, as expected under a more persistent shock process. Additionally, output becomes more strongly correlated with consumption, investment, and hours worked, while its correlation with the trade balance and current account declines."

    "text": "Answer\n 📥 Download Matlab Code (4_10_code.zip) \n\n1. Calibration Results\nUsing a distance minimization procedure similar to that in Exercise 4.8, we estimate the following parameters to match the 1960–2011 Canadian moments:\n\n\\(\\rho = 0.3950\\)\n\\(\\tilde{\\eta} = 0.0118\\)\n\\(\\phi = 0.0173\\)\n\\(\\psi_1 = 0.001071\\)\n\nThese should be compared to the earlier calibration in Table 4.1. The updated values reflect the need to match more persistent and volatile output.\n\n\n2. Theoretical Second Moments\nThe model-implied second moments (standard deviations and serial correlations) are as follows:\n\n\n\nVariable\nStd. Dev.\nSerial Corr.\n\n\n\n\nOutput (\\(y\\))\n3.0826\n0.6170\n\n\nInvestment (\\(i\\))\n9.0391\n0.0686\n\n\nTrade balance / \\(y\\)\n7.9202\n0.9968\n\n\n\nThese moments are in line with the third panel of Table 4.2 for 1960–2011.\n\n\n3. Interpretation\nThe model does a reasonable job matching the key business cycle statistics. The higher persistence in the data led to a larger \\(\\rho\\) in the calibration, which increases output volatility through its effect on investment dynamics. The lower estimated \\(\\eta\\) offsets this by reducing overall shock volatility, helping the model match observed output variance.\n\n\n4. Comparison with 1946–1985 Calibration\n\nPeriod 1946–1985: \\(\\sigma_A = 0.0142\\), \\(\\sigma_y = 3.0826\\)\nPeriod 1960–2011: \\(\\sigma_A = 0.0133\\), \\(\\sigma_y = 3.7245\\)\n\nDespite a lower \\(\\sigma_A\\) in the later period, \\(\\sigma_y\\) is higher. This reflects that a more persistent shock process (higher \\(\\rho\\)) amplifies the effect of shocks on output via capital accumulation. To prevent overpredicting volatility, \\(\\eta\\) had to fall. Thus, increasing \\(\\rho\\) while reducing \\(\\eta\\) leads to higher output volatility even if technology volatility itself is lower."

Comment.\nReport the share of the variance of TFP growth explained by the nonstationary productivity shock and contrast it to the case without interest-rate shocks and financial frictions.\nProduce a table displaying the actual and predicted standard deviation, correlation with output growth, and serial correlation of output growth, consumption growth, investment growth, and the trade-balance-to-output ratio. Comment especially on the model’s ability to explain the predicted volatility of the trade-balance-to-output ratio and the serial correlations of output and investment growth, which are the second moments that the version of the model without interest-rate shocks or financial frictions has the hardest time explaining.\nAdd one more line per moment to this table, displaying the predicted second moment under perfect information. For this step, set \\(\\sigma_n=0\\) and reestimate the model. Discuss your findings."

    "text": "Problem\nThe model of section 5.3 introduces three modifications to the SOE-RBC model with stationary and nonstationary technology shocks of section 5.2, namely, a longer sample, additional shocks, and financial frictions. A result of section 5.3 is that once these modifications are put in place, nonstationary productivity shocks cease to play a central role in explaining business cycles. The goal of this exercise is to disentangle which of the three aforementioned modifications is responsible for this result. To this end, estimate, using Bayesian methods, one at the time, the following three variants of the model:\n\nShorter Sample: Use data from 1975-2005.\nOnly Technology Shocks: Set to zero the standard deviations of the preference shock, the country-interest-rate shock, and the spending shock.\nNo Financial Frictions: Set \\(\\psi=0.001\\) and \\(\\eta=0\\).\n\nUse the same priors as in the body of the chapter and produce MCMC chains of 1 million draws with an acceptance rate of 25 percent. In each case, report the implied variance decomposition of TFP, output growth, consumption growth, investment growth, and the trade-balance-to output ratio and measures of model fit, using the formats of tables 5.4, 5.5 and 5.6 and equation (5.13). Discuss your results."

    "text": "Problem\nThe model presented in section 5.3 assumes that permanent productivity shocks affect not only the productivity of labor and capital in producing market goods, but also the country premium, home production, and government spending. For instance, the assumption that the country interest rate depends on \\(\\widetilde{D}_{t+1}/X_t\\), implies that a positive innovation in \\(X_t\\) in period \\(t\\), causes, all other things equal, a fall in the country premium. In this exercise, we attenuate this type of effect by reformulating the model. Let\n\\[\n\\widetilde{X}_t = \\widetilde{X}_{t-1}^{\\zeta}X_t^{1-\\zeta},\n\\]\nwith \\(\\zeta\\in[0,1)\\). Note that the original formulation obtains when \\(\\zeta=0\\).

Assume a uniform prior distribution for \\(\\zeta\\) with support \\([0,0.99]\\) and produce 1 million draws from the posterior distribution of the parameter vector. Present the estimation results in the form of a table like table 5.4. Discuss your findings.\nCharacterize numerically the predictions of the model. In particular, produce tables similar to tables 5.5 and 5.6. Discuss your results and provide intuition.\nCompute the impulse responses of output, consumption, investment, the trade-balance-to-output ratio, and the country interest rate to a one-percent innovation in \\(g_t\\) for three values of \\(\\zeta\\), namely, 0, its posterior median, and 0.99."
